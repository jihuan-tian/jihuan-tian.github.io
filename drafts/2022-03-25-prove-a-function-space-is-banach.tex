\subsection{Prove a function space $X$ is a Banach space under a norm $\norm{\cdot}$}

\begin{itemize}
\item Show that the definition of $\norm{\cdot}$ is really a norm, i.e. it should satisfy positive
  definiteness, scalar multiplication and triangle inequality
\item $(X,\norm{\cdot})$ is a linear space, i.e. closeness of addition and scalar multiplication
  should be proved in the sense of finite norm.
\item Every Cauchy sequence in $X$ is convergent
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Select a Cauchy sequence $\left\langle u_n \right\rangle$ in the function space $X$ and show that it converges
    to a function $u$ pointwise. This is natural as long as the codomain of $\left\langle u_n \right\rangle$ which
    contain their actual ranges is complete, which can be ensured when the codomain is $\mathbb{R}$ or
    $\mathbb{C}$.
  \item Prove $u \in X$ in the sense of finite norm.
  \item Up to now, the convergence of $u_n$ to $u$ is still in the pointwise sense. Hence we still
    need to prove $u_n$ converges to $u$ in the norm assigned to $X$.
  \end{itemize}
