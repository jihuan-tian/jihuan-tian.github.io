<p>Comment on 2018-08-20 The deities that led to Ramanujan’s infinity and is embodied in this biography pacified the mind.</p>

<h1 id="prologue">Prologue</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>P176 Ramanujan was a man who grew up praying to stone deities; who for
most of his life took counsel from a family goddess, declaring it was
she to whom his mathematical insights were owed; whose theorems would,
at intellectually backbreaking cost, be proved true—yet leave
mathematicians baffled that anyone could divine them in the first
place.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P211 And yet, can we understand Ramanujan’s life without some
appreciation for the mathematics that he lived for and loved? Which is
to say, can we understand an artist without gaining a feel for his
art? A philosopher without some glimpse into what he believed?
Mathematics, I am mindful, presents a special problem to the general
reader (and writer). Art, at least, you can see. Philosophy and
literature, too, have the advantage that, however recondite, they can
at least be rendered into English. Mathematics, however, is mired in a
language of symbols foreign to most of us, explores regions of the
infinitesimally small and the infinitely large that elude words, much
less understanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P237 Spend any length of time among the people of South India and it
is hard not to come away with a heightened sense of spirituality, a
deepened respect for hidden realms, that implicitly questions Western
values and ways of life. In the West, all through the centuries,
artists have sought to give expression to religious feeling, creating
Bach fugues and Gothic cathedrals in thanks and tribute to their gods.
In South India today, such religious feeling hangs heavy in the air,
and to discern a spiritual resonance in Ramanujan’s mathematics seems
more natural by far than it does in the secular West.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P241 Ramanujan’s champion, Hardy, was a confirmed atheist. Yet when he
died, one mourner spoke of his profound conviction that the truths of
mathematics described a bright and clear universe, exquisite and
beautiful in its structure, in comparison with which the physical
world was turbid and confused. It was this which made his
friends . . . think that in his attitude to mathematics there was
something which, being essentially spiritual, was near to religion.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P245 The same, but more emphatically, goes for Ramanujan, who all his
life believed in the Hindu gods and made the landscape of the
Infinite, in realms both mathematical and spiritual, his home. “An
equation for me has no meaning,” he once said, “unless it expresses a
thought of God.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P256 The Cauvery was a familiar, recurring constant of Ramanujan’s
life. At some places along its length, palm trees, their trunks heavy
with fruit, leaned over the river at rakish angles. At others, leafy
trees formed a canopy of green over it, their gnarled, knotted roots
snaking along the riverbank. During the monsoon, its waters might rise
ten, fifteen, twenty feet, sometimes drowning cattle allowed to graze
too long beside it. Come the dry season, the torrent became a memory,
the riverbanks wide sandy beaches, and the Cauvery itself but a feeble
trickle tracing the deepest channels of the riverbed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P277 The Cauvery was a place for spiritual cleansing; for agricultural
surfeit; for drawing water and bathing each morning; for cattle, led
into its shallow waters by men in white dhotis and turbans, to drink;
and always, for women, standing knee-deep in its waters, to let their
snaking ribbons of cotton or silk drift out behind them into the
gentle current, then gather them up into sodden clumps of cloth and
slap them slowly, relentlessly, against the water-worn rocks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="2-sarangapani-sannidhi-street">2. Sarangapani Sannidhi Street</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>P387 In many parts of South India, the land was, for much of the year,
a bleak brown. But here, midst the rice fields of the Cauvery, the
landscape suddenly thickened with lush greenery in a rich palette of
shades and textures. Farmers nursed delicate infant rice seedlings in
small, specially watered plots whose rich velvety green stood out
against neighboring fields. When, after thirty or forty days, the
plants were healthy and strong, laborers individually scooped them out
with their root pods and transplanted them to large, flooded fields;
these made for a softer green. There the plants grew until a yellower
hue signaled they were ready for harvest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P401 Kumbakonam was more cosmopolitan than its surroundings, was a
center for the work of eye, hand, and brain, which needs a degree of
leisure to pursue.</p>

<h2 id="5-the-goddess-of-namakkal">5. The Goddess of Namakkal</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>P616 It would take a few minutes for his eyes to adjust to the
shadows. There, in the Sarangapani temple’s outer hall, it seemed
gloomy after the bright sun outside. What light there was swept in
from the side, softly modeling the intricate sculpted shapes, the
lions and geometrically cut stone, of the hall’s closely spaced
columns. Away further from the light, nestled among the columns, were
areas favored by bats for nesting. Sometimes Ramanujan could hear the
quick, nervous swatting of their wings. Or even see them hanging from
the ceiling, chirping away, then abruptly fluttering into flight.
Unlike Western churches which, architecturally, drew you higher and
higher, here the devout were pulled, as it were, inner and inner.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P625 Always the temple stirred with little bright devotional fires,
the chanting of mantras, the smell of incense in small shrines and
dark niches devoted to secondary deities. The closer one approached to
the central shrine itself, the darker it grew—more mysterious, more
intimately scaled, progressively smaller, tighter, closer. What from
the noisy street beyond the temple walls might have seemed a fit site
for great public spectacles, here, inside, within stone grottos
blackened by centuries of ritual fire presided over by bare-chested
Brahmin priests, was a place for one man and his gods.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P691 South India was a world apart. All across India’s northern
plains, the centuries had brought invasion, war, turmoil, and change.
Around 1500 B.C. light-skinned Aryans swept in through mountain passes
from the north. For eight centuries, Buddhism competed with
traditional Brahminism, before at last being overpowered by it.
Beginning in the tenth century, it was the Muslims who invaded,
ultimately establishing their own Moghul Empire. One empire gave way
to another, the races mingled, religions competed, men fought.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P708 In South India an undiluted spirituality had had a chance to
blossom. If the North was like Europe during the Enlightenment, the
South was, religiously, still rooted in the Middle Ages. If Bombay was
known for commerce, and Calcutta for politics, Madras was the most
single-mindedly religious. It was a place where there was less, as it
were, to distract you—just rice fields, temples, and hidden gods.
Here, in this setting, with the secular world held at bay, within a
traditional culture always willing to see mystical and magical forces
at work, Ramanujan’s belief in the unseen workings of gods and
goddesses, his supreme comfort with a mental universe tied together by
invisible threads, came as naturally as breath itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P736 The three chief deities in the Hindu pantheon, Brahma, Siva, and
Vishnu, were traditionally represented as, respectively, the
universe’s creative, destructive, and preserving forces. In practice,
however, Brahma, once having fashioned the world, was seen as cold and
aloof, and tended to be ignored. So the two great branches of
Brahminic Hinduism became Shaivism and Vaishnavism. Shaivism had a
kind of demonic streak, a fierceness, a malignity, a raw sexual energy
embodied in the stylized phallic symbol known as a lingam that was the
centerpiece of every Shaivite temple. Think of sweeping change, of
cataclysmic destruction, and you invoked Lord Siva. Vaishnavism,
befitting its identification with the conserving god Vishnu, had more
placid connotations. One contemporary English account likened it to
the Spirit of Man—a distinctly gentler idea. Figuring largely in
Vaishnavism were Rama and Krishna, heroes of Indian legend, and two of
the incarnations, or avatars, in which Vishnu appears.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P768 Ramanujan’s maternal grandmother, Rangammal, was a devotee of
Namagiri and was said to enter a trance to speak to her. One time, a
vision of Namagiri warned her of a bizarre murder plot involving
teachers at the local school. Another time, many years earlier, before
Ramanujan’s birth, Namagiri revealed to her that the goddess would one
day speak through her daughter’s son. Ramanujan grew up hearing this
story. And he, too, would utter Namagiri’s name all his life, invoke
her blessings, seek her counsel. It was goddess Namagiri, he would
tell friends, to whom he owed his mathematical gifts. Namagiri would
write the equations on his tongue. Namagiri would bestow mathematical
insights in his dreams.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-book-of-carr">1. The Book of Carr</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>P885 the typical mathematics text methodically worked through a
subject, setting out a theorem, then going through the steps of its
proof. The student was expected to dutifully follow along behind the
author, tracking his logic, perhaps filling in small gaps in his
reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P904 “I have, in many cases,” he explained, merely indicated the
salient points of a demonstration, or merely referred to the theorems
by which the proposition is proved. . . . The difference in the effect
upon the mind between reading a mathematical demonstration, and
originating one wholly or partly, is very great. It may be compared to
the difference between the pleasure experienced, and interest aroused,
when in the one case a traveller is passively conducted through the
roads of a novel and unexplored country, and in the other case he
discovers the roads for himself with the assistance of a map.</p>

<h2 id="3-flight">3. Flight</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>P966 As the hot breeze poured through the open windows of the railway
car, Ramanujan watched the South Indian countryside slip by at
twenty-five miles an hour. Villages of thatched roofs weathered to a
dull barn-gray; intense pink flowers poking out from bushes and trees;
palm trees, like exclamation points, punctuating the rice field
flatness. From a distance, the men in the fields beside the tracks
were little more than brown sticks, their dhotis and turbans white
cotton puffs. The women were bright splashes of color, their orange
and red saris set off against the startling green of the rice fields.
A snapshot might have recorded the scene as a charming bucolic
tableau, but Ramanujan saw people everywhere engaged in purposeful
activity. Men tending cattle. Women, stooped over in the fields,
nursing the crops. Sometimes they worked alone, sometimes together in
groups of a dozen or more, baskets perched atop their heads, fetching
water from streams. Occasionally, a child with its mother would glance
up from the surrounding fields and wave at the train bearing Ramanujan
north to Vizagapatnam.</p>

  <p>P1035 Was he respected as a mathematician? Was he deemed a dutiful
son, a good Brahmin? Did he hold an important scholarship? Had he won
a prize? The answers, as outward markers of acceptance or success,
counted—and certainly never more so than now, as a teenager, at an
age of exquisite sensitivity to the opinions of others. Tales of
Ramanujan’s youth reveal a boy content to camp out on the pial of his
house and work at mathematics, outwardly oblivious to the raucous play
of his friends out on the street. Often, wrapped up in mathematics, he
was oblivious. At other times, though, he must have wanted to be part
of it. His thirst for public acknowledgment of his gifts, his pain
when denied it, and his sensitivity to social slight, show how deeply,
at another level, he really cared.</p>

to help him find a job. It is, in other words, edited. It contains few
outright errors; mostly, Ramanujan caught them earlier. And most of
its contents, arrayed across fifteen or twenty lines per page, are
entirely legible; one needn’t squint to make out what they say. No,

it is like a museum retrospective, the viewer being guided through

his interest. For him, it wasn’t what his equation stood for that

it upside down and inside out, seeing in it new possibilities, playing
with it as the poet does words and images, the artist color and line,
the philosopher ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1196 Ramanujan’s notebooks ranged over vast terrain. But this terrain
was virtually all “pure” mathematics. Whatever use to which it might
one day be put, Ramanujan gave no thought to its practical
applications. He might have laughed out loud over the monkey and the
guava problem, but he thought not at all, it is safe to say, about
raising the yield of South Indian rice. Or improving the water system.
Or even making an impact on theoretical physics; that, too, was
“applied.” Rather, he did it just to do it. Ramanujan was an artist.
And numbers—and the mathematical language expressing their
relationships—were his medium.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1201 Ramanujan’s notebooks formed a distinctly idiosyncratic record.
In them even widely standardized terms sometimes acquired new meaning.
Thus, an “example”—normally, as in everyday usage, an illustration
of a general principle—was for Ramanujan often a wholly new theorem.</p>

  <p>P1276 Ramanujan was doing what great artists always do—diving into
his material. He was building an intimacy with numbers, for the same
reason that the painter lingers over the mixing of his paints, or the
musician endlessly practices his scales. And his insight profited. He
was like the biological researcher who sees things others miss because
he’s there in the lab every night to see them. His friends might later
choose to recall how he made short work of school problems, could see
instantly into those they found most difficult. But the problems
Ramanujan took up were as tough slogging to him as school problems
were to them. His successes did not come entirely through flashes of
inspiration. It was hard work. It was full of false starts. It took
time.</p>

  <p>P1290 But in India that haughty spirit, independence and deep thought
which the possession of great wealth sometimes gives ought to be
suppressed. They are directly averse to our power and interest. The
nature of things, the past experience of all governments, renders it
unnecessary to enlarge on this subject. We do not want generals,
statesmen and legislators; we want industrious husbandmen. If we
wanted restless and ambitious spirits there are enough of them in
Malabar to supply the whole peninsula. If Thackeray’s sentiments
mirrored British educational policy in India, no better evidence for
it could be found than Ramanujan, for whom college might have seemed
aimed at suppressing “haughty spirit, independence, and deep thought.”
Indeed, Indian higher education’s failure to nurture one of such
undoubted, but idiosyncratic, gifts could serve as textbook example of
how bureaucratic systems, policies, and rules really do matter.
People, as individuals, appreciated and respected Ramanujan; but the
System failed to find a place for him. It was designed, after all, to
churn out bright, well-rounded young men who could help their British
masters run the country, not the “restless and ambitious spirits”
Thackeray warned against.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1301 The great nineteenth-century mathematician Jacobi believed, as
E. T. Bell put it in Men of Mathematics, that young mathematicians
ought to be pitched “into the icy water to learn to swim or drown by
themselves. Many students put off attempting anything on their own
account till they have mastered everything relating to their problem
that has been done by others. The result is that but few ever acquire
the knack of independent work.” Ramanujan tossed alone in the icy
waters for years. The hardship and intellectual isolation would do him
good? They would spur his independent thinking and hone his talents?
No one in India, surely, thought anything of the kind. And yet, that
was the effect. His academic failure forced him to develop
unconventionally, free of the social straitjacket that might have
constrained his progress to well-worn paths.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1331 One friend, P. C. Mahalanobis—the man who discovered him
shivering in his Cambridge room—later wrote how Ramanujan “spoke
with such enthusiasm about the philosophical questions that sometimes
I felt he would have been better pleased to have succeeded in
establishing his philosophical theories than in supplying rigorous
proofs of his mathematical conjectures.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1333 In the West, there was an old debate as to whether mathematical
reality was made by mathematicians or, existing independently, was
merely discovered by them. Ramanujan was squarely in the latter camp;
for him, numbers and their mathematical relationships fairly threw off
clues to how the universe fit together. Each new theorem was one more
piece of the Infinite unfathomed. So he wasn’t being silly, or sly, or
cute when later he told a friend, “An equation for me has no meaning
unless it expresses a thought of God.”</p>

borrow a book, or see a professor, or hear a lecture. Or he’d wander
over to the temple. But mostly, Ramanujan would sit working on the
pial of his house on Sarangapani Sannidhi Street, legs pulled into his
body, a large slate spread across his lap, madly scribbling, seemingly
oblivious to the squeak of the hard slate pencil upon it. For all the
noisy activity of the street, the procession of cattle, of sari-garbed
women, of half-naked men pulling carts, he inhabited an island of
serenity. Human activity passed close by, yet left him alone, and
free, unperturbed by exams he had no wish to take, or subjects he had
no wish to study.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1356 A determination to succeed and to sacrifice everything in the
attempt. That could be a prescription for an unhappy life; certainly
for a life out of balance, sneering at timidity and restraint.

watch the children playing in the street with what one neighbor
remembered as “a blank and vacant look.” But inside, he was on fire.</p>

also a young man who hung around the house, who had flunked out of two
colleges, who had no job, who indulged in mystical disquisitions that
few understood, and in mathematics that no one did. What value was his
work to anyone? Maybe he was a genius, maybe a crank. But in any case,
why waste one’s time and energy in activity so divorced from the
common purposes of life? Didn’t his father, working as a lowly clerk
in a silk shop, do the world and himself more good than he?</p>

suggests, they were his legacy. And they were a selling document, his
ticket to a job—“evidence,” as his English friend Neville would
later put it, “that he was not the incorrigible idler his failures
seemed to imply.” Propelled by necessity, he had begun calling on
influential men who, he thought, could give him a job. And slung under
his arm as he called were—just as photographers have their

had become, in the year and a half since his marriage, a door-to-door

telling stories along the way. Ramanujan wore his spirits on his
sleeve. There was something so direct, so unassuming, so transparent
about him that it melted distrust, made you want to like him, made you
want to help him.</p>

<h2 id="3-leisure-in-madras">3. “Leisure” in Madras</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1593 The word leisure has undergone a shift since the time
Ramachandra Rao used it in this context. Today, in phrases like
leisure activity or leisure suit, it implies recreation or play. But
the word actually goes back to the Middle English leisour, meaning
freedom or opportunity. And as the Oxford English Dictionary makes
clear, it’s freedom not from but “to do something specified or
implied” [emphasis added]. Thus, E. T. Bell writes of a famous
seventeenth-century French mathematician, Pierre de Fermat, that he
found in the King’s service “plenty of leisure”—leisure, that is,
for mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1599 In his Report on Canara, Malabar and Ceded Districts, Thackeray
spoke of the “leisure, independence and high ideals” that had
propelled Britain to its cultural heights. The European “gentleman of
leisure,” free from the need to earn a livelihood, presumably
channeled his time and energy into higher moral and intellectual
realms. Ramanujan did not belong to such an aristocracy of birth, but
he claimed membership in an aristocracy of the intellect. In seeking
“leisure,” he sought nothing more than what thousands born to elite
status around the world took as their due.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P1609 As a Brahmin, Ramanujan may also have felt freer to seek the
sort of constructive idleness he thought he needed—and perhaps even,
in some measure, conceived as his due. Traditionally, Brahmins were
recipients of alms and temple sacrifices; earning a livelihood was for
them never quite the high and urgent calling it was for others.
Uncharitably, it might be said that Ramanujan exhibited a prima
donna-like self-importance that left him unwilling to study what he
had no wish to study, or to work for any reason but to support his
mathematics. Less harshly—and, on balance, with greater justice—he
was a secular sanyasi.</p>

  <p>P1824 Early the following year, K. S. Srinivasan, a student at Madras
Christian College who’d known Ramanujan back in Kumbakonam, dropped by
to see him at Summer House. “Ramanju,” he said, “they call you a
genius.” Hardly a genius, replied Ramanujan, “Look at my elbow. That
will tell you the story.” It was rough, dirty, and black. Working from
his large slate, he found the quick flip between writing hand and
erasing elbow a lot faster, when he was caught up in the throes of his
work, than reaching for a rag. “My elbow is making a genius of me,” he
said. Why, Srinivasan asked, didn’t he just use paper? Can’t afford
it, replied Ramanujan. He was getting money from Ramachandra Rao. But
that only went so far. Paper? He’d need four reams of it a month.
Another friend from the Summer House days, N. Ramaswami Iyer [no
relationship to the “Professor”] also recalled Ramanujan’s “huge
appetite” for paper. Ramaswami pictured him lying on a mat, his shirt
torn, “his long hair carelessly bound up with a piece of thin string,”
working feverishly, notebooks and loose sheets of plain white paper
piled up around him. A friend from Pachaiyappa’s who met him in Madras
a little later, T. Srinivasacharya, recalled that, for want of paper,
Ramanujan would sometimes write in red ink on paper already written
upon.</p>

huge sacks of grain. Then streets of jewelry stalls, of textile shops,
oilmongers, basketweavers, fruit and vegetable wholesalers . . . And
everywhere, driving it all, was muscle power, black-haired men,
shoeless and shirtless, clad only in their dhotis, ribs and muscles

upstairs overlooking the street, slates propped on their knees,
sometimes until midnight, the interminable scraping of their
slate-pencils often keeping others up. Sometimes, after they had gone

Bromwich’s Theory of Infinite Series was the text to consult. If still

all flint and stone, pierced by tiny slotted windows; these formidable
architectural details stemmed from the Peasants’ Revolt, and from
bloody town-gown battles at Oxford, both still of recent memory in the
fourteenth century when the school was founded. Scholarship students
like Hardy lived in a sort of intellectual ghetto within the college,
a fortresslike complex of medieval, gray stone buildings, worlds apart
from the sunny openness of Cranleigh. As a new student, Hardy was
grilled on “notions”—a vast lexicon of jargon and slang peculiar to
Winchester. Some of them went back to the Latin, some were submerged
in the mists of the school’s medieval past. Collectively, they defined
good form and bad, as Winchester, across the span of centuries, had
come to see them. “Tugs” was stale news. To “brock” was to bully. A
“remedy,” derived from the Latin remedium, meant “a holiday.” A
“tunding” was a flogging at the hands of a prefect, or senior student
officer. Learning your notions made for no idle study. There were

  <p>P2597 Say you draw a circle on a piece of paper; obviously, the circle
divides the paper into two regions—within the circle, and outside

outside the circle: surely you can connect them (not necessarily with
a straight line) without cutting the circle, right? And just as
surely, if one point lies outside the circle and the other inside,
then any continuous line linking them has to cut the circle . . .
“Surely?” “Just as surely?” For English mathematicians untouched by
the precision of the Continent, such notions were obvious, scarcely
worthy of another thought. But Jordan actually stated these seemingly
self-evident truths as theorems and set about trying to prove them
rigorously. In fact, he couldn’t do it, or at least not completely;
his proofs were laced with flaws, and his successors had later to
correct them. But they invoked just the kind of close, sophisticated
reasoning that Hardy, coming upon Jordan now, at the age of barely
twenty, found beguiling. “I shall never forget,” Hardy later wrote of
Jordan’s book, whose second, much-improved edition had just appeared
in 1896, “the astonishment with which I read that remarkable work, the
first inspiration for so many mathematicians of my generation, and
learnt for the first time as I read it what mathematics really meant.”</p>

<p>笔记 - P2804 A bud formed in the early years.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P2830 Havelock Ellis once wrote that “by inborn temperament, I was,
and have remained, an English amateur; I have never been able to
pursue any aim that no passionate instinct has drawn me towards.”
There was, as in Ellis, a streak of disdain in the English character
for mere necessity; the amateur, bless his heart, did what he did for
love, for the sake of beauty or truth, not because necessity compelled
it. This streak had gained more reasoned form in the philosophy of G.
E. Moore, Hardy’s Apostolic “father.” His Principia Ethica
represented, in the words of Gertrude Himmelfarb, a “manifesto of
liberation” stressing love, beauty, and truth. “And even love, beauty,
and truth were carefully delineated as to remove any taint of utility
or morality. Useless knowledge was deemed preferable to useful,
corporeal beauty to mental qualities, present and immediately
realizable goods to remote or indirect ones.” G. H. Hardy’s
mathematics would emerge as the consummate manifestation, within his
own field, of Moore’s credo. “I have never done anything ‘useful,’ ”
is how he would put it years later. “No discovery of mine has made or
is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least
difference to the amenity of the world.” He would never say so,
perhaps he did not even see it, but he had taken Moore’s sensibilities
and applied them to mathematics. “Hardyism,” someone would later
dignify this doctrine, so hostile to practical applications; and
Hardy’s Mathematician’s Apology, written almost half a century later,
would embody it on every page. That mathematics might aid the design
of bridges or enhance the material comfort of millions, he wrote, was
scarcely to say anything in its defense. For such mathematics, he bore
only contempt. It is undeniable that a good deal of elementary
mathematics . . . has considerable practical utility. [But] these
parts of mathematics are, on the whole, rather dull; they are just the
parts which have least aesthetic value. The “real” mathematics of the
“real” mathematicians, the mathematics of Fermat and Euler and Gauss
and Abel and Riemann, is almost wholly “useless.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P2867 Newton was the premier genius of his age, the most fertile mind,
with the possible exception of Shakespeare’s, ever to issue from
English soil. And yet he would later be called “the greatest disaster
that ever befell not merely Cambridge mathematics in particular but
British mathematical science as a whole.” For to defend his
intellectual honor, as it were, generations of English mathematicians
boycotted Europe—steadfastly clung to Newton’s awkward notational
system, ignored mathematical trails blazed abroad, professed disregard
for the Continent’s achievements. “The Great Sulk,” one chronicler of
these events would call it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P2873 Continental mathematics laid stress on what mathematicians call
“rigor,” the kind to which Hardy had first been exposed through
Jordan’s Cours d’analyse and which insisted on refining mathematical
concepts intuitively “obvious” but often littered with hidden
intellectual pitfalls. Perhaps reinforced by a strain in their
national character that sniffed at Germanic theorizing and
hairsplitting, the English had largely spurned this new rigor. Looking
back on his Cambridge preparation, Bertrand Russell, who ranked as
Seventh Wrangler in the Tripos of 1893, noted that “those who taught
me the infinitesimal Calculus did not know the valid proofs of its
fundamental theorems and tried to persuade me to accept the official
sophistries as an act of faith. I realized that the Calculus works in
practice but I was at a loss to understand why it should do so.” So,
it is safe to say, were most other Cambridge undergraduates.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P2992 At the root of Britain’s mathematical backwardness, Hardy was
sure, lay the Tripos system. Originally the means to a modest
end—determining the fitness of candidates for degrees—the Tripos
had become an end in itself. As Hardy saw it, English mathematics was
being sapped by the very system designed to select its future leaders.
Around 1907, he became secretary of a panel established to reform it.
But in fact, he championed its reform only as a first step toward
doing away with it altogether, and only because he saw no hope, just
then, for more radical change.</p>

  <p>P3019 Hardy’s vehemence suggests a peculiar rift within his
personality. Here was a man—a friend would one day liken him to “an
acrobat perpetually testing himself for his next feat”—who set up
rating scales at the least provocation, loved competitive games,
grilled new acquaintances on what they knew, held up mathematical work
to the highest standards—yet swore eternal enmity to the Tripos
system which, in a sense, was the ultimate rating scale, the ultimate
test.</p>

legible, rounded schoolboy script distinguished only by crossed t’s
that didn’t cross. His handwriting had always been neat; but here, if
possible, it was neater still, as if he realized the gulf of
skepticism that divided him from Hardy and dared not let an illegible
scrawl widen it. It was a wise precaution; the gulf was indeed great.
For Hardy, Ramanujan’s pages of theorems were like an alien forest
whose trees were familiar enough to call trees, yet so strange they
seemed to have come from another planet; it was the strangeness of
Ramanujan’s theorems that struck him first, not their brilliance. The
Indian, he supposed, was just another crank.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3107 The Indian manuscript scraped and tugged at his composure with,
as Snow wrote, its “wild theorems. Theorems such as he had never seen
before, nor imagined.” Were they wild and unimaginable because they
were silly, or trivial, or just plain wrong, with nothing to support
them? Or because they were the work of some rare flower of exotic
genius? Or maybe they were merely well-known theorems the Indian had
found in some book and cleverly disguised by expressing in slightly
different form—making it just a matter of time before Hardy found
them out? Or perhaps it was all a practical joke? Hoaxes, after all,
were much in vogue just then. Many Englishmen holding high positions
in the Indian Civil Service had endured the mathematical Tripos or
were otherwise versed in mathematics—well versed enough, perhaps, to
pull off such a stunt. And how best to dupe your old Cambridge friend
Hardy? Why, you’d garb familiar “theorems” in unfamiliar attire,
purposely twist them into weird shapes. But who in India was adept
enough to do it? Maybe the hoax had originated in Europe. But would
the perpetrator have gone to the trouble of securing a genuine Madras
postmark . . . ?</p>

in jest—doubted he existed at all.</p>

  <p>P3163 Littlewood had recently moved into rooms on D Staircase of
Nevile’s Court. Pausing in the arched doorway at the staircase’s base,
he could sight through the portico to the arches across the court
framed within it. It was an arresting view—perhaps one reason he
remained there for sixty-five years, until his death in 1977. From
Hardy’s rooms, it was just nineteen steps down the winding stone
staircase, then forty paces through the gate into Nevile’s Court and
around to D Staircase. Yet normally the two men communicated by mail
or college messenger and did not, in any case, routinely run off to
confer with one another in person. And so, that winter evening in
1913, to let Littlewood know he wished to meet with him after Hall,
Hardy sent word by messenger.</p>

bishops, headmasters, judges, and . . . politicians.” When Hardy
attended a cricket match and knew none of the competitors, he would
tap his own favorites on the spot. These “had to be the
under-privileged, young men from obscure schools, Indians, the unlucky
and diffident. He wished for their success and, alternatively, for the
downfall of their opposites.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3305 It was not until a windy Saturday, February eighth, the day
following his birthday, that Hardy sat down to deliver to Ramanujan
the verdict on his gifts that Cambridge already knew. “Trinity
College, Cambridge,” he wrote at the top, and the date, then began:
“Dear Sir, I was exceedingly interested by your letter and by the
theorems . . .” With an opening like that, Ramanujan would, at least,
have to read on. But in the very next sentence, Hardy threw out his
first caveat: “You will however understand that before I can judge
properly of the value of what you have done, it is essential that I
should see proofs of some of your assertions.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3310 Proof. It wasn’t the first time the word had come up in
Ramanujan’s mathematical life. But it had never before borne such
weight and eminence. Carr’s Synopsis, Ramanujan’s model for presenting
mathematical results, had set out no proofs, at least none more
involved than a word or two in outline. That had been enough for Carr,
and enough for Ramanujan. Now, Hardy was saying, it was not enough.
The mere assertion of a result, however true it might seem to be, did
not suffice.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3368 In fact, it was not just Walker, Spring, and others in the
Madras mathematical community who had been fortified by Hardy’s
letter. It was Ramanujan himself. For all his confidence in his
mathematical prowess, Ramanujan needed outside approval, affirmation.
Now he had it. Hardy’s letter took him seriously. And the
pronouncement delivered by this unseen F.R.S., this man reputed to be
the finest pure mathematician in England? It was no vague, empty one
filled with glowing accolades that Ramanujan might, in an anxious
moment, dismiss, but rather nine pages of specific, richly detailed
comment: a statement Ramanujan had written on his sixth page of
theorems about a series expressible in terms of pi and the Eulerian
constant could be deduced from a theorem in Bromwich’s Infinite Series
(the book M. J. M. Hill, in his letter of two months before, had
advised that he consult). A theorem on the same page involving
hyperbolic cosines Hardy himself had proved in Quarterly Journal of
Mathematics. Hardy knew.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3376 In assessing Ramanujan’s work, Hardy had informally broken it
down into three broad categories—those results already known or
easily derived from known theorems; those curious, and perhaps even
difficult, but not terribly important; and those promising to be
important indeed, if they could be proved. In Hardy’s mind, plainly,
it was those in this third category that weighed most heavily.</p>

  <p>P3550 For an orthodox Hindu—and Ramanujan came from a very orthodox
Hindu family—traveling to Europe or America represented a form of
pollution. It was in the same category as publicly discarding the
sacred thread, eating beef, or marrying a widow. And, traditionally,
it had the same outcome—exclusion from caste. That meant your
friends and relatives would not have you to their homes. You could
find no bride or bridegroom for your child. Your married daughter
couldn’t visit you without herself risking excommunication. Sometimes,
you couldn’t go into temples. You couldn’t even get the help of a
fellow casteman for the funeral of a family member. Here was the grim,
day-to-day meaning of the word outcaste.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3558 However much he may have yearned for England, Ramanujan found in
Madras little reprieve from tradition’s hold. Madras was no oil-fed
Houston, or railroad-driven Chicago, where ambitions surged and dreams
were meant to be lived. Its population was static, barely changing in
the past decade. It was flat, built low, spread out over the
countryside; there were no Himalayan peaks to draw the imagination
upward, no great towers to serve as symbols of human aspiration. More
than the other great cities of India, Madras clung in spirit to the
villages and towns of the surrounding countryside.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3884 A few of Ramanujan’s results were, Hardy could see, wrong. Some
were not as profound as Ramanujan liked to think. Some were
independent rediscoveries of what Western mathematicians had found
fifty years before, or a hundred, or two. But many—perhaps a third,
Hardy would reckon, perhaps two-thirds, later mathematicians would
estimate—were breathtakingly new. Ramanujan’s fat, mathematics-rich
letters, Hardy now saw, represented but the thinnest sampling, the
barest tip of the iceberg, of what had accumulated over the past
decade in his notebooks. There were thousands of theorems,
corollaries, and examples. Maybe three thousand, maybe four. For page
after page, they stretched on, rarely watered down by proof or
explanation, almost aphoristic in their compression, all their
mathematical truths boiled down to a line or two.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3895 Around that time, Hardy was visited by the Hungarian
mathematician George Polya, who borrowed from him his copy of
Ramanujan’s notebooks, not yet then published. A few days later,
Polya, in something like a panic, fairly threw them back at Hardy. No,
he didn’t want them. Because, he said, once caught in the web of
Ramanujan’s bewitching theorems, he would spend the rest of his life
trying to prove them and never discover anything of his own.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3910 After the second letter, Littlewood had written Hardy, “I can
believe that he’s at least a Jacobi.” Hardy was to weigh in with a
tribute more lavish yet. “It was his insight into algebraical
formulae, transformation of infinite series, and so forth, that was
most amazing,” he would write. In these areas, “I have never met his
equal, and I can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3920 Euler and Jacobi were not just generic “great mathematicians”;
it was not capriciously that Hardy and Littlewood had compared
Ramanujan to them. Rather, these two men represented a particular
mathematical tradition of which Ramanujan, too, was part—that of
“formalism.” Formal, here, carries no suggestion of “stiff” or
“stodgy.” Euler, Jacobi, and Ramanujan had (along with deep insight) a
knack for manipulating formulas, a delight in mathematical form for
its own sake. A “formal result” suggests one fairly bubbling up from
the formulas themselves, almost irrespective of what those formulas
mean. Computers today manipulate three-dimensional contours regardless
of whether they represent economic forecasts or car bumpers. Some
painters care as much for form, line, or texture as they do subject
matter. The mind of the mathematical formalist works along similar
lines. All mathematicians, of course, manipulate formulas. But
formalists were almost magicians at it, uncannily selecting just the
tricks and techniques needed to obtain intriguing new results. They
would replace one variable in an equation by another, thus reducing it
to simpler form. They would know when to integrate a function, when to
differentiate it, when to construct a new function, when to worry
about rigor, when to ignore it.</p>

  <p>P3932 Useful formulas tended to be found early in the development of a
new mathematical field, pointing the way to future work. But as a
field matured and these early formulas were applied and extended, they
often grew too complicated to be useful. By Ramanujan’s time,
something like this had happened in branch after branch of
mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3946 For Hardy’s part, confronting the mystery of Ramanujan’s mind
would constitute, as his friend Snow had it, “the most singular
experience of his life: what did modern mathematics look like to
someone who had the deepest insight, but who had literally never heard
of most of it?” Ramanujan “combined a power of generalization, a
feeling for form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his
hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own
peculiar field, without a rival in his day,” Hardy would conclude. As
for his ultimate influence, Hardy couldn’t, at the time he wrote, say;
in a sense, its very peculiarity undercut it. “It would be greater,”
he suggested, “if it were less strange.” But, he added, “One gift it
has which no one can deny—profound and invincible originality.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P3953 Having gone so out on a limb to bring Ramanujan to Cambridge,
Hardy, after familiarizing himself with the notebooks, probably felt a
little relieved, too. And proud. “Ramanujan was,” he would write, “my
discovery. I did not invent him—like other great men, he invented
himself—but I was the first really competent person who had the
chance to see some of his work, and I can still remember with
satisfaction that I could recognize at once what a treasure I had
found.”</p>

European mathematicians, like Kronecker, Hermite, and Weber. Still,

interest and contains a large number of new results.” If nothing else,
it was astounding how rapidly some of his series converged to pi.
Leibniz’s series, on page 209, is lovely—but almost worthless for
getting pi; three-decimal-point accuracy demands no fewer than five
hundred terms. Some of Ramanujan’s series, on the other hand,
converged with astonishing rapidity. In one, the very first term gave
pi to eight decimal places. Many years later, Ramanujan’s work would
provide the basis for the fastest-known algorithm, or step-by-step
method, for determining pi by computer.</p>

medieval manuscripts, and killing many civilians. The burning of
Louvain horrified the world, galvanized public opinion against
Germany, and united France, Russia, and England more irrevocably yet.

“intuition.” And yet, it was the very power of his intuition that, in

because its response is logarithmic. If light intensity rises by a
factor of a thousand, which can be written as 103, the response, in
principle, may be only about three times as much instead of a
thousand. Well, it was just such a slow logarithmic growth in this

to explain why. But mathematicians are not normally content to guess,
or assume, or assert that something is true; they must prove it, or
feel they have—or as Hardy would put it, “exhibit the conclusion as
the climax of a conventional pattern of propositions, a sequence of

that, if you went far enough, the prime number theorem was destined to
sometimes predict less, not more, than the actual number of primes.
Later, someone found the number below which this reversal was
guaranteed to take place. And it was a number so big you had to
laugh—a number more than the number of particles in the universe,
more than the possible games of chess. It was, Hardy would say, “the
largest number which has ever served any definite purpose in
mathematics.” And it made for the ultimate illustration of how
intuition could serve you badly, and so must always be subject to
proof.</p>

You can differentiate a function without realizing the function cannot

in fact, they contribute substantially to the series sum. Or you can
assume that an operation correct for a finite number of terms is
correct for an infinite number. Or you can integrate a function
between two points, yet fail to note where the integral may be
undefined, and so carry through your proof such meaningless quantities
as “infinity minus infinity.”</p>

  <p>P4267 Ramanujan’s intuition steered him clear of many obstacles of
which his truncated education had failed to warn him. But not all. The
problem was not only that he was sometimes wrong; it was that he
lacked mathematical knowledge enough to tell when he was right and
when he was wrong. He stated correct and incorrect theorems with the
same aplomb, the same sweet, naive confidence. And when he did offer
proofs, they scarcely warranted the name.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P4273 It was just Ramanujan’s luck, then, to be thrown in with Hardy,
whose insistence on rigor had sent him off almost single-handedly to
reform English mathematics and to write his classic text on pure
mathematics; who had told Bertrand Russell two years before that he
would be happy to prove, really prove, anything: “If I could prove by
logic that you would die in five minutes, I should be sorry you were
going to die, but my sorrow would be very much mitigated by pleasure
in the proof.” Ramanujan, Intuition Incarnate, had run smack into
Hardy, the Apostle of Proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P4298 In what, in some ways, was his greatest achievement, then, Hardy
brought Ramanujan mathematically up to speed without muzzling his
creativity or damping the fires of his enthusiasm. It would have been
easy to sniff at his shortcomings and dutifully correct them, like a
bad editor who crudely blue-pencils his way through a delicate
manuscript. But he knew that Ramanujan’s mathematical insight was
rarer by far than even the most formidable technical mastery. It was
fine to know all the mathematical tools needed to prove a
theorem—but you had to have a theorem to prove in the first place.
That was easy to forget as you flipped through the Proceedings of the
London Mathematical Society. There, as in any mathematics journal, the
proof was made to seem the culmination of a hundred closely reasoned
steps ranging over a dozen pages. There, mathematics could seem no
more than a neat lockstep march to certainty, B following directly
from A, C from B, . . . Z from Y. But no mathematician actually worked
that way; logic like that reflected the demands of formal proof but
hinted little at the insights leading to Z. Rather, as Hardy himself
would write, “a mathematician usually discovers a theorem by an effort
of intuition; the conclusion strikes him as plausible, and he sets to
work to manufacture a proof.”</p>

<p>Ramanujan的天赋令人称奇赞叹，而Hardy对Ramanujan的发现与引导则是伟大和感人至深了。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P4308 The theorem itself was apt to emerge just as other creative
products do—in a flash of insight, or through a succession of small
insights, preceded by countless hours of slogging through the problem.
You might, early on, try a few special cases to informally “prove” the
result to your own satisfaction. Then later, you might go back and,
with a full arsenal of mathematical weapons, supply the kind of
fine-textured proof Hardy championed. But all that came later—after
you had something to prove. Besides, it was mostly technical, like the
laws of evidence; you could learn it. Rigor, Littlewood would observe,
“is not of first-rate importance in analysis beyond the undergraduate
state, and can be supplied, given a real idea, by any competent
professional.” Given a real idea—that was the rare commodity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P4314 “Mathematics has been advanced most by those who are
distinguished more for intuition than for rigorous methods of proof,”
the German mathematician Felix Klein once noted. (Added Louis J.
Mordell, an American mathematician who would ultimately succeed Hardy
in his chair at Cambridge: “To very few other mathematicians are
Klein’s remarks . . . so appropriate as to Ramanujan.”) A “real idea”
wasn’t dished up, like a Tripos problem, by some anonymous
mathematical Intelligence. It had to come from somewhere, had to be
seen before it could be proved. But where did it come from? That was
the mystery, the source of all the circular, empty, ultimately
unsatisfying explanations that have always beset students of the
creative process. Here, “talent” came in, and “genius,” and “art.”
Certainly it couldn’t be taught. And certainly, when in hand, it had
to be nurtured and protected.</p>

  <p>P4537 The college fellows in their black academic robes solemnly
trooped into the great candlelit Hall. A webbed understructure of
wooden arches graced the high ceiling. Dryden and Tennyson, Newton,
Thackeray, Francis Bacon, and other Trinity notables glowered down
from their portraits on the walls. Silver adorned bare wood tables;
the tablecloths of peacetime were gone now for fear the light they
reflected might beckon German zeppelins. Once all the fellows were
seated, the senior among them, sitting at one end of the long table,
recited a Latin grace. And the meal began. This was High Table, so
called because the tables at which the fellows ate were set on a
platform built up about four inches from the floor. At Trinity, as
elsewhere in Cambridge, it was the focal point of the college’s social
life, and long-standing notions of conversational good form governed
it. For one thing, you never got too serious. “If one has done a hard
day’s thinking one does not want to work at conversation,” Littlewood
would say. “Dinner conversation is in fact easy and relaxed. No
subject is definitely barred, but we do not talk shop in mixed
company, and, Heaven be praised, we abstain from the important and
boring subject of politics.” It was a place not of great profundity
but of wit, wine, and release—release from the high tension of
translating ancient Greek, or writing about the fall of
Constantinople, or proving a new theorem in the theory of numbers.
Here, the Important receded into distant memory. Here, trifles had
their day.</p>

  <p>P4617 Laurence Young, the son of two mathematical contemporaries of

surmised that he was bored. But when one day Young suggested that the
water might be too rough for their excursion, “his face dropped . . .
and I quickly looked again at the lake and pronounced it smooth. This
is typical of Cambridge—what you admire, you merely do not speak
of.” Littlewood himself would remark that “When you make your speech
at a Trinity Fellowship Election, do not expect them to break into
irrepressible applause; no one will blink an eyelid.” It was a wall
erected around one’s feelings, a great silence of the emotions. In
Cambridge, the emphasis was on ideas, events, things, work,
games—anything, it seemed, but the deeply personal.</p>

streets of Madras. The bright colors of religious festivals parading
down the streets of Kumbakonam, accompanied by the strumming and
jingling of the musicians. The reds and oranges of sari-clad women
along the banks of the Cauvery, white dhotis setting off the dark
brown skin of laborers in the fields. The vibrant greens of the
vegetables, the coconuts and bananas and mangos sold down by the
market near the river. And always, the bright blue sky and high

  <p>P4677 Mathematician Norbert Wiener would one day note how, in one
sense, number theory blurs the border between pure and applied
mathematics. In search of concrete applications of pure math, one
normally turns to physics, say, or thermodynamics, or chemistry. But
the number theorist has a multitude of real-life problems before him
always—in the number system itself, a bottomless reservoir of raw
data. It is in number theory, wrote Wiener, where “concrete cases
arise with the greatest frequency and where very precise problems
which are easy to formulate may demand the mathematician’s greatest
power and skill to resolve.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P4774 we proceeded to test this hypothesis by means of the numerical
data most kindly provided for us by Major MacMahon, we found a
correspondence between the real and the approximate values of such
astonishing accuracy as to lead us to hope for even more. Taking n =
100, we found that the first six terms of our formula gave
190568944.783 + 348.872 − 2.598 + .685 − .318 + .064 190569291.996
while p(100) = 190569292; so that the error after six terms is only
.004. Similar precision applied to p(200). Their method was supplying
an answer whose error was not just “bounded”—which could, after all,
mean bounded but large—but small enough to round off to the nearest
integer. “These results,” wrote Hardy and Ramanujan, “suggest very
forcibly that it is possible to obtain a formula for p(n), which not
only exhibits its order of magnitude and structure, but may be used to
calculate its exact value for any value of n.”</p>

  <p>P4813 Ramanujan and Hardy: as a mathematical team, they would remind
Pennsylvania State University mathematician George Andrews of the
story of the two men, one blind and the other lacking legs, who
together could do what no normal man could. They were a formidable
pair. On the strength of their work on partitions alone, which by
itself justified Ramanujan’s trip to England, their names would be
linked forever in the history of mathematics. Cambridge mathematician
Béla Bollobás has observed that while Hardy furnished the technical
skills needed to attack the problem, I believe Hardy was not the only
mathematician who could have done it. Probably Mordell could have done
it. Polya could have done it. I’m sure there are quite a few people
who could have played Hardy’s role. But Ramanujan’s role in that
particular partnership I don’t think could have been played at the
time by anybody else. Whatever the proper assignment of credit, “We
owe the theorem,” Littlewood would write, “to a singularly happy
collaboration of two men, of quite unlike gifts, in which each
contributed the best, most characteristic, and most fortunate work
that was in him. Ramanujan’s genius did have this one opportunity
worthy of it.”</p>

<h2 id="4-deepening-the-hole">4. Deepening the Hole</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>P4857 At one point, writing to Ramanujan, who was then in the
hospital, about their current work, his eagerness for the mathematical
fray plainly warred with his concern for his friend’s health: “If I
get out any more I will write to you again. I wish you were better and
back here—there would be some splendid problems to work at. I don’t
know if you feel well enough to think about such difficult things
yet.” Then, a postscript: “At present you must do what the doctors
say. However you might be able to think about these things a little:
they are very exciting.” As maddeningly equivocal as the letter was,
Ramanujan would have been obtuse indeed to miss its message: The work
awaits you. And so, if any part of Ramanujan wanted to relax, pursue
his pet philosophical notions, investigate the psychic theories of the
English physicist Oliver Lodge that so intrigued him, take the train
into London to visit the zoo, as he did once or twice, or otherwise
stray from mathematics, it got scant support from Hardy. Hardy’s
urgings, to be sure, found fertile soil in Ramanujan’s own obsessive
bent.</p>

  <p>P4873 By early 1917, he was a man on a mission, propelled toward his
destiny, oblivious to all but mathematics. After three years in
Cambridge, his life was Hardy, the four walls of his room, and work.
For thirty hours at a stretch he’d sometimes work, then sleep for
twenty. Regularity, balance, and rest disappeared from his life. He
was not the first man to sacrifice his health on the altar of
mathematics. Jacobi gave this retort to a friend who worried that
excessive devotion to his work might make him sick: “Certainly I have
sometimes endangered my health by overwork, but what of it? Only
cabbages have no nerves, no worries. And what do they get out of their
perfect wellbeing?” And before Jacobi, there was Newton himself.
“Never careful of his bodily health,” E. T. Bell wrote of him, “Newton
seems to have forgotten that he had a body which required food and
sleep when he gave himself up to the composition of his masterpiece.
Meals were ignored or forgotten.”</p>

that national identities were less blurred in those days, making for
more to adapt to; India was more inviolably India, England more
England. There were not, as there are today, Indian restaurants and
food stores littering the streets of London and Cambridge. As for the
climate, there was no air-conditioning or central heating to moderate
its extremes. You either endured it or got out. That was why
well-heeled Englishmen journeyed to Italy or Spain during the winter;
or why, in India during the worst of the summer heat, they visited
hill stations like Simla in the North, or Ootacamund in the South.
Those who could not escape, meanwhile, faced the full force of the
heat, eased only by feeble fans or, midst the damp and chill of
English winters, were left to the mercies of ineffectual coal fires.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P4924 Ramanujan did indeed keep to the diet of his “cult,” and from
even his first days in England, before the war, doing so had posed
problems for him. In a letter to a friend soon after his arrival, he
complained about “the difficulty of getting proper food. Had it not
been for the good milk and fruits here I would have suffered more. Now
I have determined to cook one or two things myself and have written to
my native place to send some necessary things for it.” In other
letters, he asked that certain provisions be sent him or no longer
sent him, gave accounts of shipments gone astray or arriving in poor
condition, expressed thanks for those that did arrive intact. Monthly,
Narayana Iyer sent him powdered rice in tin-lined boxes. Others sent
him spices or pickled fruits and vegetables. Back in India, Janaki
later recalled, Ramanujan would sometimes abruptly stop eating, or
else hurry through it, to pursue a mathematical thought; meals were
something to be dispensed with. But now, with no one to cook for him,
they had become an awful bother. Preparing from scratch South Indian
meals—assembling the ingredients, soaking and grinding lentils,
cutting vegetables, boiling rice, and so on, all the way through the
final cooking—took time. And time, while working on what to him were
the most seductively challenging problems in the world, he resented
having to give up. So, as Neville’s wife, Alice, for one, would
report, Ramanujan sometimes cooked only once a day, or sometimes only
once every other day, and then at weird hours in the early morning.
The simplest “solution,” of course, was a species of asceticism. Back
in Madras, he had enjoyed mango, or banana, or jackfruit with his rice
and yogurt. And there was brinjal, prepared that special way his
mother did it, and . . . But the great days of good South Indian meals
were gone. He had written Subramanian in 1915, “I am not in need of
anything as I have gained a perfect control over my taste and can live
on mere rice with a little salt and lemon juice for an indefinite
time.”</p>

  <p>P5215 Seven decades later, Janaki, eighty-eight years old, was a
stooped old woman, living in Triplicane, Madras, with her
forty-five-year-old adopted son, Narayanan, his wife and three
children. Their modest house stood behind a low wall with an iron
fence, a few feet back from a busy street accented by coconut palms
heavy with fruit. Inside, wrapped in a burgundy sari, Janaki sat on a
bare wood bench against a wall, where she had only to look up to see a
bronze bust of her late husband, garlanded with flowers, the gift of
his admirers from around the world. Her skin was glossy, stretched
over bones barren of fat. Hunched and frail, she got around the house
only by painfully pushing a wooden chair, which functioned as a
walker. Nearly deaf, she could hear Narayanan only when he shouted
through a rolled-up magazine into her ear. As she replied, in loud
staccato bursts, to questions asked her, her face would sometimes grow
contorted with the effort of simply listening and speaking. At other
times, it would break out into a broad, captivating smile. According
to some who knew her, Janaki was more confident and assertive now than
in years past. And yet, such was a daughter-in-law’s place as she had
been brought up to accept it that even now, nearing ninety and known
to be bitter about her treatment at Komalatammal’s hands, she took
pains to show respect for her long-dead mother-in-law. Through
Narayanan, she expressed gratitude to her for the opportunity to marry
Ramanujan. And she asked that certain difficulties in their
relationship be couched in properly respectful circumlocutions; that
it be said, for example, that they were simply “not able to see eye to
eye”; and that she fled the household at one point merely because she
“wanted to change the atmosphere.”</p>

his various naval campaigns. But as you lift your gaze to the top of
the great 167-foot-tall fluted column, Nelson himself is just a
cloaked figure in a three-cornered admiral’s cap, too high to make out
even the bare outline of his features. One day, offered the
hypothetical choice between being commemorated by such a statue,
glorious but distant, and a lower, more approachable one, Hardy would

  <p>P5348 Something of this same enigmatic flavor makes its way into
Littlewood’s account of Ramanujan’s work with partitions. Attempting
to trace the progress of Ramanujan’s thinking, he ultimately throws up
his hands, frustrated and perplexed: There is, indeed, a touch of real
mystery [here]. If only we knew[the result in advance], we might
be forced, by slow stages, to the correct form of Ψq. But why was
Ramanujan so certain there was one? Theoretical insight, to be the
explanation, had to be of an order hardly to be credited. Yet it is
hard to see what numerical instances could have been available to
suggest so strong a result. And unless the form of Ψq was known
already, no numerical evidence could suggest anything of the
kind—there seems no escape, at least, from the conclusion that the
discovery of the correct form was a single stroke of insight.</p>

  <p>P5418 Despite his emphasis on rigor, G. H. Hardy was not blind to the
virtues of vague, intuitive mental processes in mathematics. Bromwich,
he would write, for example, “would have had a happier life, and been
a greater mathematician, if his mind had worked with less precision.
As it was, even the best of his work is a little wanting in
imagination. For mastery of technique in a wide variety of subjects,
it would be difficult to find his superior, but he lacked the power of
‘thinking vaguely.’ ” And some such extraordinarily developed ability
to “think vaguely” may have been among Ramanujan’s special gifts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P5450 Hardy agreed with Hadamard that unconscious activity often plays
a decisive part in discovery; that periods of ineffective effort are
often followed, after intervals of rest or distraction, by moments of
sudden illumination; that these flashes of inspiration are explicable
only as the result of activities of which the agent has been
unaware—the evidence for all this seems overwhelming.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P5495 Hardy, though, did not admit to such ambivalence. For him, the
whole spiritual realm was just so much bunkum. He knew—this was his
faith—that wherever Ramanujan’s genius came from, there was
something straightforward to explain it. He would write: I have often
been asked whether Ramanujan had any special secret; whether his
methods differed in kind from those of other mathematicians; whether
there was anything really abnormal in his mode of thought. I cannot
answer these questions with any confidence or conviction; but I do not
believe it. My belief is that all mathematicians think, at bottom, in
the same kind of way, and that Ramanujan was no exception. Ramanujan’s
mathematics, he was saying, was the product of the reasoned working of
a reasoning mind, and nothing more needed to be said.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P5554 Undeterred by the Trinity rebuff and hoping to boost Ramanujan’s
morale, Hardy set about trying to get his friend the recognition he
felt he deserved. On December 6, 1917, Ramanujan was elected to the
London Mathematical Society. Then, two weeks later, on December 18,
Hardy and eleven other mathematicians—Hobson and Baker were among
them, as were Bromwich, Littlewood, Forsyth, and Alfred North
Whitehead, Bertrand Russell’s collaborator on Principia
Mathematica—together put him up for an honor more esteemed by far
than any fellowship of a Cambridge college: they signed the
Certificate of a Candidate for Election that nominated him to become a
Fellow of the Royal Society. The Royal Society was Britain’s
preeminent scientific body, going back to 1660 when Christopher Wren
and Robert Boyles helped found it. There were, at about the time Hardy
put up Ramanujan, 39 foreign members, including the Russian Ivan
Pavlov, the American Albert Michelson (of Michelson-Morley experiment
fame), and 6 other Nobel Prize winners. The Royal Society counted in
all 464 members in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and every
branch of science. Being an F.R.S. meant that forevermore those three
little letters would be appended to your name, appear on your own
scientific papers, and on letters addressed to you. It was the
ultimate mark of scientific distinction. Younger scientists lusted
after it, older scientists lamented their lack of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P5580 There was no question in Hardy’s mind, or Littlewood’s, or
anyone else’s, that Ramanujan merited the honor. Still, few candidates
made it the first time out, and by normal practice his nomination was
premature. Hardy had been thirty-three years old when elected in 1910.
Littlewood himself had made it only the previous February, also at age
thirty-three—more than a decade, and dozens of notable mathematical
papers, beyond his early glory as a Senior Wrangler. Ramanujan, still
twenty-nine at the time of his nomination, had contributed to European
mathematics for just a few years and still had a modest publication
record, at least in number. But Hardy’s concern for Ramanujan’s health
moved him to press his claim with unusual urgency. J. J. Thomson,
discoverer of the electron, winner of the Nobel Prize in 1906, and
then president of the Royal Society, had asked him to outline the
circumstances surrounding Ramanujan’s candidature. “If he had not been
ill I would have deferred putting him up a year or so,” Hardy
admitted: “not that there is any question of the strength of his
claim, but merely to let things take their ordinary course. As it is,
I felt no time must be lost.”</p>

  <p>P5624 Just what triggered Ramanujan’s desperate bound onto the tracks
doesn’t come down to us. Certainly, though, if the mere refusal of his
dinner guests to accept a third helping could foment such a storm of
shame in him that he had to get up and leave, deeper humiliation might
spark action more precipitous still. And in 1917 he had certainly
experienced his share of it. Rejected by Trinity. Seemingly abandoned
by his wife. Left sick and dependent in the sanatorium, helpless even
to command the food he wanted. Unable to produce the work he felt his
friends expected of him. Confronted by the knowledge that much of his
past work had been rediscovery and, viewed blackly enough, a waste of
time.</p>

idea of going”; something they said had pushed one of Ramanujan’s
numerous buttons. Mindful of Ramanujan’s sensitivities, and of no mind
to trespass on them, Hardy advised Dewsbury that “the suggestion would
best be made more or less officially and by letter simultaneously to

functions could be represented as infinite series. Strict rules
governed the formation of these series, and so long as you observed
them, they always had particularly intriguing properties. For example,
they were “quasi doubly periodic” and they were “entire functions.”
Over the years since Jacobi had first studied them, theta functions
had come to exert a profound impact on fields ranging from
mathematical physics to number theory. Books devoted to them typically
wound up bridging vast terrain, yielding connections to fields to
which at first they might seem wholly unrelated.</p>

whom, when he wasn’t exploding at her in a fit, he now had a warmer,
more relaxed relationship. “He was uniformly kind to me,” Janaki
recalled. “In his conversation he was full of wit and humor,” was
forever cracking jokes. As if trying to cheer her up, he plied her
with tales of England—of his visits to the British Museum, and the
animals he’d seen there, of the time in Cambridge when an English
guest eating a South Indian dish he had prepared chomped down on a
piece of hot pepper . . . His life came down a little from the heights
of mathematics to small things, human things. He would summon Janaki
with a little bell, or would tap with a stick. He told C. S. Rama Rao
Sahib, Ramachandra Rao’s son-in-law, how much he craved the rasam he
had enjoyed almost a decade before in those destitute days of 1910 at
Victoria Hostel—and loved it when somebody brought him some. Still,
it was not an easy death. Whatever cheerfulness or equanimity he could
muster—and some of his friends preferred later to remember him that
way—papered over a grim despair. He was sullen and angry much of the
time. His mood was volatile, resting on a hair trigger. Janaki felt
later—so had Hardy in England, and so did many of his friends in
India—that his illness had affected his mind. He was forever raving
at one thing or another. There was a tray kept nearby with lentils,
spices, and rice, and once, in a fit of anger and pain, Ramanujan
pounded it all together with a stick. Narasimha Iyengar, hurt at
finding Ramanujan so sullen and cold when he greeted him at the
Central Station, visited him now again on Harrington Road. “I found to
my great grief that though physically living, he was mentally dead to
the world, even to his once dear friends.” Toward the end, “he was
only skin and bones,” Janaki remembered later. He complained terribly
of the pain. It was in his stomach, in his leg. When it got bad,
Janaki would heat water in brass vessels and apply hot wet towels to
his legs and chest; “fomentation,” it was called, standard therapy at
the time. But through all the pain and fever, through the endless
household squabbles, through his own disturbed equanimity, Ramanujan,
lying in bed, his head propped up on pillows, kept working. When he
requested it, Janaki would give him his slate; later, she’d gather up
the accumulated sheets of mathematics-covered paper to which he had
transferred his results and place them in the big leather box which he
had brought from England. “He wouldn’t talk to anyone who came to the
house,” said Janaki later. “It was always maths. . . . Four days
before he died he was scribbling.” Early on April 26, 1920, he lapsed
into unconsciousness. For two hours, Janaki sat with him, feeding him
sips of dilute milk. Around midmorning or perhaps a little earlier, he
died. With him were his wife, his parents, his two brothers, and a few
friends. He was thirty-two years old. At the funeral later that day,
most of his orthodox Brahmin relatives stayed away; Ramanujan had
crossed the waters and, too sick on his return to make the trip to
Rameswaram for the purification ceremonies his mother had planned, was
still tainted in their eyes. Ramachandra Rao arranged the cremation,
through his son-in-law and Ramanujan’s boyhood friend,
Rajagopalachari. At about one in the afternoon, his emaciated body was
put to the flames on the cremation ground near Chetput. The next day,
assigning it Registration No. 228, a government clerk officially
recorded his death.</p>

  <p>P6301 I have no uncles or cousins to protect me. We have no property,
as you might have known very well. I have a great desire to study and
I wish “to neglect worldly ends, all dedicated to closeness and the
bettering of my mind” (Tempest). I have no taste, sorry to say, for
Mathematics. I like to read Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Tennyson, and
wish to travel in the fairy land “half flying half on foot.” I do not
know how to feed them. Therefore, I humbly request you to write to the
Madras University to give a monthly allowance to us. I have been told
that my brother is entitled to get a sum from the Cambridge
University. In short, I am a young man. One day passes with great
difficulty. I do not know how to protect them. Unless any arrangement
is made to support us, we have to go a-begging from door to door. I
entrust the whole case into your hands. It is your bounden duty to
protect us.</p>

  <p>P6320 she asked Hardy to intercede on her sons’ behalf with the
government and with the India Office in London. She wanted for them
high positions in the post office department—the better-educated
Tirunarayanan as probationary superintendent of post offices, and
Lakshmi Narasimhan as inspector of post offices in Madras.</p>

  <p>P6334 She had learned to embroider and work a sewing machine in
Bombay, and so now she scratched out a living making clothes and
teaching tailoring to girls. In 1937, S. Chandrasekhar, the
astrophysicist, asked by Hardy to try to find a good photograph of
Ramanujan next time he was in India, tracked her down in Triplicane.
She was, Chandrasekhar reported back, “having a rather difficult life,
some of her unscrupulous relatives having swindled her out of such
financial resources as R[amanujan] had left her,” and unable even to
get hold of a copy of her husband’s Collected Papers, published a few
years before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P6475 For some years, his work went into eclipse, as new areas of
mathematics, wholly distant from those Ramanujan had pursued, became
fashionable. The Collected Papers, while it had its disciples, was no
best-seller, even by scholarly standards. Just 42 books were sold the
first year, 209 the second, and an officer of Cambridge University
Press predicted in a letter to Hardy late in 1929 that it would be
another ten years before the first printing, of 750, was sold out.
“When I came to the United States [after World War II],” Freeman
Dyson would recall, “I was all by myself as a devotee.” To the
mathematical avant-garde of the day, Ramanujan’s work was no more than
a “backwater,” a vestige of the nineteenth century. But that, in time,
would change.</p>

  <p>P6643 Computers, scarcely the dream of which existed in 1920, have
also drawn from Ramanujan’s work. “The rise of computer algebra makes
it interesting to study somebody who seems like he had a computer
algebra package in his head,” George Andrews once told an interviewer,
referring to software that permits ready algebraic manipulation.
Sometimes in studying Ramanujan’s work, he said at another time, “I
have wondered how much Ramanujan could have done if he had had MACSYMA
or SCRATCHPAD or some other symbolic algebra package. More often I get
the feeling that he was such a brilliant, clever and intuitive
computer himself that he really didn’t need them.” Then, too, a
modular equation in Ramanujan’s notebooks led to computer algorithms
for evaluating pi that are the fastest in use today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P6677 “What we do may be small, but it has a certain character of
permanence,” wrote Hardy of the work of pure mathematicians, “and to
have produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it
be a copy of verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done
something utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of men.”</p>

  <p>P6992 Later that year, the Royal Society notified him that he was to
receive its highest honor, the Copley Medal. “Now I know that I must
be pretty near the end,” he told Snow. “When people hurry up to give
you honorific things there is exactly one conclusion to be drawn.”</p>

  <p>P6999 The 1939 heart attack began the long physical and emotional
slide that led to his suicide attempt. And it was in its wake, about a
month after France fell to the Nazis, that he put the finishing
touches to A Mathematician’s Apology, his paean to mathematics. Snow
saw the Apology “as a book of haunting sadness,” the work of a man
long past his creative prime—and knowing it. “It is a melancholy
experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing
about mathematics,” wrote Hardy. Painters despised art critics? Well,
the same went for any creative worker, a mathematician included. But
writing about mathematics, rather than doing it, was all that was left
him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P7006 I still say to myself when I am depressed, and find myself
forced to listen to pompous and tiresome people, “Well, I have done
one thing you could never have done, and that is to have collaborated
with both Littlewood and Ramanujan on something like equal terms.”
Ramanujan. All these twenty years later, Ramanujan remained part of
him, a bright beacon, luminous in his memory. “Hardy,” said Mary
Cartwright, his student during the 1920s and whom Hardy would describe
as the best woman mathematician in England, “practically never spoke
of things about which he felt strongly.” Yet at one remove from his
listener, on the printed page, he became a little freer. And there he
revealed Ramanujan’s hold on him: “I owe more to him,” he wrote, “than
to any one else in the world with one exception [Littlewood?] and my
association with him is the one romantic incident in my life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P7035 From then on, over the next thirty-five years, Hardy did all he
could to champion Ramanujan and advance his mathematical legacy. He
encouraged Ramanujan. He acknowledged his genius. He brought him to
England. He trained him in modern analysis. And, during Ramanujan’s
life and afterward, he placed his formidable literary skills at his
service. “Hardy wrote exquisite English,” the Manchester Guardian
would say of him, citing especially his obituary notice of Ramanujan
as “among the most remarkable in the literature about mathematics.” To
mathematician W. N. Bailey, it was “one of the most fascinating
obituary notices that I have ever read.” And it was Hardy’s book on
Ramanujan, more than anything he knew about him otherwise, that
convinced Ashis Nandy to make Ramanujan a prime subject of his own
book. Hardy’s pen fired the imagination, shaping Ramanujan’s reception
by the mathematical world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P7048 Someone once said of Hardy that “conceivably he could have been
an advertising genius or a public relations officer.” Here was the
evidence for it.</p>
