<meta name="description" content="Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night. Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night. Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. — Dylan Thomas" />

  <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

  <p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

  <p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

  <p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

  <p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

  <p>— Dylan Thomas</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Do not go gentle into that good night” 这句诗出现于电影《星际穿越 Interstellar》中。此时，人类在地球上几乎没有生存的希望与可能，不得不向宇宙茫茫黑暗的深处进军。这句诗令人感到由衷的悲状。</p>

<p>无论是数学推理还是算法编程开发，水都很深，不是通过几天、几月、甚至几年的集中突击就可以一蹴而就的。同样地，真正地在心流状态下进入深度工作模式、触及并小心地理顺旁杂的细节，也像是走入宇宙无尽的黑暗。这个时候，需要以个人的弱小但绝不屈服的精神来面对理论知识的无限、问题对于智力与动手能力的挑战、自身认知与理解力的局限。</p>

<p>虽然我并不是顶级聪明的人，但是在实践中发现，通过长时间地思考和玩味一个问题，确实能够使自己的认知获得质的提升。这个提升的达成是随机出现的。你可以把这个现象归因为灵感和运气。虽然看似飘忽不定、不可捉摸，但其产生是有必然性的。因此，在长期保持专注的前提下，对于顿悟与灵光一现要抱以十足的信心。</p>

<p>这是对于勤能补拙这个道理在实践上的验证，而不仅仅是在理性与情感上的形式认可。所以说，王阳明“知行合一”的说法是绝对正确的，只有通过笃行才能够获得对人生、做事等各方面道理的真正理解。</p>
