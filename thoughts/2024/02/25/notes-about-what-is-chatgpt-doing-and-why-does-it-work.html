    <p>The following contents are my notes taken during reading the book “What is ChatGPT Doing and Why does it work?”, which is written by Stephen Wolfram. I hope they will help you get an impression or basic understanding about the capability and potential of ChatGPT as well as its limitations. Then with a critical mind, we can reconsider how to incorporate ChatGPT into our existing study, research, programming, knowledge management, or even creative activities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Features of ChatGPT
    <ul>
      <li>Collected prodigious amounts of data from the web for training
        <ul>
          <li>Several billion human-written web pages → Trillion words</li>
          <li>Non-public web pages: 100 times more → 100 trillion words</li>
          <li>5 million digitized books → 100 billion words</li>
          <li>Text within videos and audios</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Number of weights in the neural net: 175 billion (ChatGPT 3).</li>
      <li>Generate reasonable texts from the human point of view, handle human-like or human-judge-like tasks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mechanism of ChatGPT
    <ul>
      <li>It is <strong>not</strong> based on theory or first principles. The neural net is only a work from engineering.</li>
      <li>Its “creativity” or “ingenuity” is based on interpolation or extrapolation.</li>
      <li>
        <p>“Reasonable” continuation of the text based on history and knowledge base (see Figure 1)</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="/figures/chatgpt-continuation-of-text.jpg" alt="ChatGPT continues words based on history and generates a meaningful sentence" /></p>
        <p align="center">Figure 1. ChatGPT continues words based on history and generates a meaningful sentence</p>

        <p>Compare with the discrete-time Markov model: Let \(X_1,X_2,\cdots\) be a sequence of random variables at discrete time points \(1,2,\cdots\). The probability of the random variable \(X_{n+1}\) at the time point \(n+1\) is determined by the history \(X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,\cdots\), which can be described by the conditional probability:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
P(X_{n+1}=x \vert X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \cdots, X_n=x_n)
\end{equation}\]

        <p>When \(X_{n+1}\) only depends on its predecessor \(X_n\), i.e. \(P(X_{n+1}=x \vert X_n=x_n)\), the process is Markov.</p>

        <p><em>It can be envisioned that the probabilistic history adopted by ChatGPT is very long.</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>Mechanism is inexplicable. It just works.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feature representation and neural net structure
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Embedding</p>

        <p>Representation of the essence of something by an array of numbers. Similarity or correlation between different entities is measured by their distance in such high dimensional space (see Figure 2).</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="/figures/chatgpt-words-in-semantic-space.jpg" alt="Point cloud of words in the semantic space" /></p>
        <p align="center">Figure 2. Point cloud of words in the semantic space</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Transformer</p>

        <p>Pay attention to some part of the sequence of neural net layers instead of completely using generic neural net.</p>

        <p>Therefore, our subjective perception of something or some task can be incorporated into the work flow, such as feature extraction from images based on geometric properties.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Initial several layers mimic the real world organisms or sensors and the output has some actual meanings.</li>
      <li>Deeper layers have not real world counterpart and cannot be understood.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Neural net training
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Under a given example input, it tries to minimize the difference between its output and the desired output by adjusting the 175 billion weights.</p>

        <p>This is a extremely high dimensional optimization problem. It is not that difficult to solve this problem because here are a lots of paths in this space which can lead us to the minimum, i.e. it is easy to jump out from local minima (see Figure 3).</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="/figures/high-dimensional-optimization.png" alt="Find global mimimum in high dimensional space is not that difficult" /></p>
        <p align="center">Figure 3. Find global mimimum in high dimensional space is not that difficult</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The training is sequential, the effects of each batch of examples are propagated layer by layer.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What ChatGPT can do
    <ul>
      <li>Daily routine work which does not require accuracy, ingenuity, insight, etc.</li>
      <li>Combinatorial and variational creativity</li>
      <li>General human-like things, grammar in both daily and programming languages, simple logic such as syllogism</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What ChatGPT lacks and cannot do
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Irreducible computation</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Model and theory based computation cannot be handled by ChatGPT</p>

            <p><strong>Structure limitation: ChatGPT is only a feed-forward network, without loops, which is incapable of nontrivial computation.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Requires accuracy</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Trade-off between computational capability and trainability</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Fidelity</p>

        <p>Everything generated by ChatGPT is human-like, consistent with or similar to common sense. Therefore, it lacks a solid proof or confirmation of the fidelity.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Understanding</li>
      <li>Criticism</li>
      <li>Real ingenuity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Application of ChatGPT in scientific research
    <ul>
      <li>Preliminary information collection</li>
      <li>Generate a summary of a specific topic: just for acquiring an initial impression, since it lacks insight and criticism.</li>
      <li>Provide prompt for new molecular forms and material ingredients.</li>
      <li>Assist coding with Copilot: should still be careful with the automatic prompt.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
