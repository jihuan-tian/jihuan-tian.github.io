<meta name="description" content="Before I started writing my Galerkin BEM library HierBEM, I surveyed and tried several FEM and BEM open source libraries. Even though some of them were well developed, tested and published, the status of lacking documentation, either intentionally or unintentionally, made me, with limited project experience and mathematical theory about BEM at that time, unable to build my library on top of them. Of course, my programming skill and mathematical foundation were not strong or solid enough to comprehend those open source libraries. Even up to now, there is still a large gap between me and the top level programmers or mathematicians. But anyway, I could not wait for everything to be ready. I had to start to do something. As we all know, practice makes perfect. Doing things by ourselves is the best way to learn. The giant shoulder that I finally stepped upon is the deal.II FEM library. The point that deal.II attracts me is its unparalleled documentation and abundant tutorials. Based on these materials, I started learning deal.II in 2013 and began writing HierBEM in 2020 based on deal.II’s mature infrastructure for mesh handling, finite elements, mappings, linear algebra and data output, etc." />

    <p>Before I started writing my Galerkin BEM library HierBEM, I surveyed and tried several FEM and BEM open source libraries.

Of course, my programming skill and mathematical foundation were not strong or solid enough to comprehend those open source libraries. Even up to now, there is still a large gap between me and the top level programmers or mathematicians. But anyway, I could not wait for everything to be ready. I had to start to do something. As we all know, practice makes perfect. Doing things by ourselves is the best way to learn. The giant shoulder that I finally stepped upon is the deal.II FEM library.

<p>This experience makes me realize that to make it possible for a software project keeping a long term sustainable development and maintenance, clear and well organized documentation is crucial. The documentation should contain enough tutorials and examples for users as well as explanation of technical details for library developers. And the developer documentation is more important than the user documentation.</p>

<p>Moreover, for a numerical software project, not only the data structure, work flow and architecture, the mathematical theories behind the algorithms should also be clearly and rigorously summarized, explained and illustrated.</p>

<p>For short, without the said user documentation, developer documentation and mathematical documentation, I don’t see any chance of a numerical software project’s survival. Therefore, in the HierBEM project, I make continuous efforts in this aspect with</p>

<ul>
  <li>the user and mathematical documentations coalesced into <a href="https://jihuan-tian.github.io/hierbem-site/examples/">several examples</a> and</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://jihuan-tian.github.io/hierbem-site/doxygen/index.html">developer documentation</a> generated from detailed source code comments with Doxygen.</li>
