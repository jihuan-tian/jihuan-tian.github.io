Steffen Börm said the following in his experiment finding &ldquo;[New $H^2 $-matrix algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371783087_New_H-matrix_algorithm)&rdquo;:

> I have spent a large amount of time looking for efficient algorithms for $H^2$-matrix arithmetics that can handle fairly general block structures. Following the H-matrix paradigm, the starting point is the multiplication of $H^2$-matrices.
> 
> After several years of disappointing results, the newest algorithm finally seems to be sufficiently fast. Let&rsquo;s see if a similar approach can be found for the LU factorization.

From above I can see that even for the best luminary in the BEM research area, Steffen Börm still has spent **several years** with **disappointing results** to finally achieve an efficient and usable algorithm. It is difficult for us to feel or envision how much efforts and lucubration are involved during this process. Hence, there is no reason for me to crave **quick** or **efficient** success anymore, even though it is fascinating, especially, when in front of others or comparing with other people&rsquo;s successes. What I should only be aware of and concerned about are the following points:

1.  whether I&rsquo;m working work hard enough,
2.  whether I have reviewed, reorganized and practiced newly learnt theories and
3.  whether I have mastered necessary engineering crafts, such as programming techniques.

The trick here is that the less I desire something, the quicker I get close to it.
