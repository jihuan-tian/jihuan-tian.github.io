According to the instructions [here](https://kindlemodding.org/), I followed these procedures:

-   Identify the model type of my Kindle device.
-   Install WinterBreak, which is a jailbreak released on New Yearâ€™s Day 2025 by HackerDude.
-   Install a hotfix which prevents Kindle from firmware update in the future.
-   Install MobileRead Package Installer (MRPI).
-   Install Kindle Unified Application Launcher (KUAL).
    
    Copy the file `Update_KUALBooklet_ALLDEVICES_KS2_install.bin` to the root directory of Kindle, then update the device. Run `;log mrpi` in the search bar does not work.
-   Install KoReader.
    -   Copy images into the file system as wallpapers.
    -   Install Stardict dictionaries, such as Oxford Advanced Learners and OED, into KoReader&rsquo;s folder `koreader/data/dict`.
        
        Convert Goldendict format dictionaries to Stardict format using Python package `pyglossary`:
        
        ```text
        pip install pyglossary
        pyglossary <dictionary>.mdx <dictionary>.ifo
        ```
    -   KoReader only has a simple Pinyin input method, no Wubi.
    -   Connect to Kindle SSH server
        
        -   Copy the public key, which is generated on the client machine with the command `ssh-keygen`, into the file `/mnt/us/koreader/settings/SSH/authorized_keys` on Kindle.
        -   Logon the SSH server with user name `root` and do not use password.
        -   Make root file system writable: `mntroot rw`.
        
        Then files can be transferred between my Linux and Kindle via `scp` or `rsync`.
