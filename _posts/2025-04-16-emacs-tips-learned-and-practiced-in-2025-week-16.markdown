-   Replace contents in multiple files in Dired mode using `query-replace-regexp`, which is bound to `Q`.
-   Replace multiple files names in Dired mode using `% R`.
-   Copy multiple files to new files with the names generated by regular expression replacement in Dired mode using `% C`. N.B. This only works for regular files, not directories. For directories, I have to use Bash command:
    
    ```text
    find . -maxdepth 1 -name "hmatrix-Tvmult*" -print | while read f; do cp -r "$f" "${f//Tvmult/Hvmult}"; done
    ```
-   Open link directly from Konsole using emacsclient by editing the text editor command as `emacsclient +LINE:COLUMN PATH` (in Konsole profile: Mouse → Miscellaneous → Text Editor Command).
