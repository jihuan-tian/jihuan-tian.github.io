Working on an existing infrastructure developed by other people or team is completely different from building an infrastructure from scratch on your own, in the ways of thinking, in the design philosophy followed, in the methodology practiced, in the tool chain adopted, etc.

In order to develop a product manageable from top to bottom, an infrastructure of your own has to be erected, expanded and enriched. Then you have a core to manipulate and the possibility to continuously polish it. Otherwise, you are destined to work within other people’s mindset and contribute minor improvements to their projects.

Here, infrastructure building does not mean crafting everything from 0 and 1. It can still be started from a platform, but itself has to be both fundamental and generic enough so that you have the complete freedom to implement various concepts and add complex mechanisms layer by layer. This is a process like an artist refining his/her masterpiece, which ultimately promises industrial quality and efficiency.
