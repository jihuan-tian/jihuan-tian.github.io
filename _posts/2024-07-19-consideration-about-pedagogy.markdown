In my opinion, the following top-down hierarchy should be instilled into students&rsquo; hearts. The importance of them degrades by level.

1.  The Prime Mover
    -   To know.
        
        > Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen - David Hilbert
    -   To predict and control via mechanized computation.

2.  Wisdom
    
    Ideas and philosophy which generate principles and techniques. It is about thought, motivation and inspiration.
    
    Examples
    
    -   Axiomatic method in mathematics.
    -   From continuous case to discrete case.
    -   Convert ODE and PDE to algebraic equation.
    -   Accurate analytical computation to approximation numerical computation, but with rigorous proof about existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution, error estimate.
    -   Infinite dimension to finite dimension.
    -   Infinite set to basis with finite or countable elements.
    -   Extract governing parameters of a complex object.
    -   Elevation: low level problem is perfectly solved by using a high level tool.

3.  Tao
    
    Generalized principles and abstract framework.
    
    Examples
    
    -   Least action principle.
    -   Variational principle.
    -   Spectrum of linear operators.
    -   Principle of linear superposition.

4.  Techniques
    
    Examples
    
    -   Integration rules.
    -   Complex number arithmetics.
    -   Tensor manipulations.

5.  Representations
    
    User interface with different styles and flavors.
    
    Examples
    
    -   Rigorous and logical.
    -   Humorous and relaxed.
    -   Static slides and dynamic demonstration.
