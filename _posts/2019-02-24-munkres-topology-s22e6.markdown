**Exercise 22.6** Recall that $$\mathbb{R}_{K}$$ denotes the real line in the $$K$$-topology. Let $$Y$$ be the quotient space obtained from $$\mathbb{R}_K$$ by collapsing the set $$K$$ to a point; let $$p: \mathbb{R}_K \rightarrow Y$$ be the quotient map.

(a) Show that $$Y$$ satisfies the $$T_1$$ axiom, but is not Hausdorff.

(b) Show that $$p \times p: \mathbb{R}_K \times \mathbb{R}_K \rightarrow Y \times Y$$ is not a quotient map.

**Comment** This exercise shows that the product map of two quotient maps is not necessarily a quotient map.

**Proof**: (a) At first, we will clarify the forms of open sets in the quotient space $$Y$$, which are defined as the images of saturated open sets in $$\mathbb{R}_K$$ under the quotient map $$p$$. Assume the set $$K$$ coalesces to $$\alpha$$, $$Y$$ can be written as: $$Y = (\mathbb{R} - K) \cup \{\alpha\}$$. For any $$x$$ in $$\mathbb{R} - K$$, $$p^{-1}(x) = x$$ and $$p^{-1}(\alpha) = K$$.  Then the saturated open sets in $$\mathbb{R}_K$$ have the following two forms:

1. open set $$U$$ of $$\mathbb{R}_K$$ which contains $$K$$;
2. $$U - K$$ with $$U$$ being arbitrary open set in $$\mathbb{R}_K$$.

Then their images under the quotient map $$p$$ are

1. $$(U - K) \cup \{\alpha\}$$ with $$K \subsetneq U$$
2. $U - K$

which comprise the quotient topology on $$Y$$. To prove $$Y$$ satisfies the $$T_1$$-axiom, by referring to Theorem 17.8, we only need to show that one-point set $$\{x_0\}$$ is closed. Then finite union of such closed singletons is also closed. To achieve this, there are two cases to be discussed.

1. If $$x_0 = \alpha$$, for any point $$x \in Y$$ and $$x \neq x_0$$, i.e. $$x \in \mathbb{R} - K$$, there exists an open set $$U - K$$ in $$Y$$ containing $$x$$, which does not contain $$x_0$$. Therefore, for all $$x \in \mathbb{R} - K$$, it does not belong to the closure of $$\{\alpha\}$$. Hence $$\{\alpha\}$$ is closed.

2. If $$x_0 \in \mathbb{R} - K$$, there are further two sub-cases:

   * For any $$x \in \mathbb{R} - K$$ and $$x \neq x_0$$, because $$\mathbb{R}_K$$ is Hausdorff, there exists open sets $$U$$ and $$V$$ in $$\mathbb{R}_K$$, such that $$x_0 \in U$$, $$x \in V$$ and $$U \cap V = \Phi$$. Then $$x_0 \in (U - K)$$, $$x \in (V - K)$$ and $$(U - K) \cap (V - K) = \Phi$$, where both $$U - K$$ and $$V - K$$ are open in $$Y$$. Hence $$\{x_0\} \cap (V - K) = \Phi$$.

   * For $$x = \alpha$$, the open set containing $$x$$ has the form $$(U - K) \cup \{\alpha\}$$ where $$U$$ is an open set in $$\mathbb{R}_K$$ containing $$K$$. Then,

     * when $$x_0 \in (-\infty, 0]$$, let $$U = (0, 2)$$;
     * when $$x_0 \in (0, 1]$$, let $$U = (0,x_0) \cup (x_0, \frac{3}{2})$$;
     * when $$x_0 \in (1, +\infty)$$, let $$U = (0,x_0)$$,

     such that $$K \subset U$$ and $$\{x_0\} \cap ((U - K) \cup \{\alpha\}) = \Phi$$.

   Combining the above two sub-cases, we have for any $$x \neq x_0$$ in $$Y$$, it does not belong to the closure of $$\{x_0\}$$. Hence $$\{x_0\}$$ is closed.

Summarize the above cases, one-point set in $$Y$$ is closed. Hence $$Y$$ satisfies the $$T_1$$-axiom.

Next, we will show $$Yâ€‹$$ is not Hausdorff.

Let $$x_1, x_2 \in Y$$, $$x_1 = \alpha$$ and $$x_2 = 0$$. For any open set in $$Y$$ containing 0 but not $$\alpha$$, it must have the form $$V - K$$ with $$V$$ being open in $$\mathbb{R}_K$$. Then there exists an open interval $$(a_2, b_2)$$ with $$a_2 < 0$$ and $$b_2 > 0$$ such that $$0 \in (a_2, b_2)$$ and $$(a_2, b_2) \subset V$$. We can find an $$n_0 \in \mathbb{Z}_+$$ such that $$\frac{1}{n_0} < b_2$$ and hence $$\frac{1}{n_0} \in (a_2, b_2)$$. Meanwhile, any open set containing $$\alpha$$ has the form $$(U - K ) \cup \{\alpha\}$$ with $$U$$ being open in $$\mathbb{R}_K$$ and $$K \subsetneq U$$. Then there exists an open interval $$(a_1,b_1)$$ such that $$\frac{1}{n_0} \in (a_1, b_1)$$ and $$(a_1, b_1) \subset U$$. Therefore, $$(a_1,b_1) \cap (a_2,b_2) \neq \Phi$$ and $$U \cap V \neq \Phi$$, especially, $$(U-K)\cap(V-K)\neq\Phi$$. Hence, $$((U-K)\cup\{\alpha\}) \cap (V-K) \neq \Phi$$. Therefore, for any open set containing 0, there is no open set containing $$\alpha$$ which has no intersection with it. So $$Y$$ is not Hausdorff.

(b) To prove this part, Exercise 13 in Section 17 should be adopted, which is presented below:

> $$X$$ is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal $$\Delta = \{x \times x \vert x \in X \}$$ is closed in $$X \times X$$.

1. If $$X$$ is Hausdorff, for any $$x_1, x_2 \in X$$ and $$x_1 \neq x_2$$, there exist $$U$$ and $$V$$ open in $$X$$ such that $$x_1 \in U$$, $$x_2 \in V$$ and $$U \cap V = \Phi$$. Because $$U$$ and $$V$$ have no common points, $$(U \times V) \cap \Delta = \Phi$$. Then according to Theorem 17.5, $$(x_1, x_2)$$ does not belong to the closure of $$\Delta$$. Because $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$ are arbitrary two different points in $$X$$, $$\Delta$$ is closed.
2. On the contrary, if $$\Delta$$ is closed, for all $$x_1, x_2 \in X$$ and $$x_1 \neq x_2$$, there exists an open set $$W$$ in $$X \times X$$ containing $$(x_1,x_2)$$ such that $$W \cap \Delta = \Phi$$. Then there exists a basis element $$U \times V$$ in $$X \times X$$ such that $$(x_1, x_2) \subset U \times V \subset W$$. Hence $$x_1 \in U$$ and $$x_2 \in V$$. Because $$(U \times V) \cap \Delta = \Phi$$, $$U \cap V = \Phi$$. Because $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$ are arbitrary two different points in $$X$$, $$X$$ is Hausdorff.

With the proved S17E13 and the obtained conclusion in part (a) that $$Y$$ is no Hausdorff, we know that the diagonal set $$\Delta$$ is not closed in $$Y \times Y$$. Meanwhile, because its preimage $$(p \times p)^{-1}(\Delta) = \{x \times x \vert x \in \mathbb{R}\}$$ is closed in $$\mathbb{R}_K \times \mathbb{R}_K$$, the product map $$p \times p$$ is not a quotient map.

Finally, the following figure illustrates the original space $$\mathbb{R}_K$$ and the quotient space $$Y$$. The transformation from $$\mathbb{R}_K$$ to $$Y$$ can be considered as merging a countable number of knots on a rope.
