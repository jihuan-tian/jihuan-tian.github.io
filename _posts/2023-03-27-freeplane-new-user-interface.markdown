The new user interface of Freeplane 1.10 shown below is amazing, compared to its old-fashioned Java style in versions <= 1.9. This gives me the lesson that to make something really cool or even great, don&rsquo;t be afraid of starting from small, ugly, coarse or fundamental. Literally, this is the only way leading to excellence and magnificence. At least, you need to have something to modify, debug and polish first.

On the contrary, if someone from the very beginning only talks about big words such as **large scale**, **platform**, he is probably a charlatan elaborating propaganda or only working on combinational or integration project based on existing handy tools. It is these tools as well as their design philosophy, theory and arts, but not the results they can produce, determine the technical level to which the human race can ascend.
