In this article, I will list some areas in which we can adopt the structured thinking methodology to achive effective execution.

1\. Structured reading: extract the skeleton of the article, generate a hierarchical structure and get corresponding keywords.

2\. Structured writing: based on structured thinking, draw out the outline and gradually refine the layered structure. The writing process, which requires several iterations of composition and refinement, begins with capturing flashing ideas in your mind as brainstorming using scattered or even unrelated keywords, then comes to concatenation of these keyword pearls by using strands of thoughts, and finally arrives at refining these elements into organized paragraphs, until the whole article.

3\. Structured note keeping: use hierarchical ordered (with numbering) or unordered (without numbering) lists to record information coming from different media, which can be further reviewed from different levels or perspectives.

4\. Structured talking: it is a verbal presentation of your structured thinking. Brevity and clarity are essential.

Tools that can be used for outlining and organizing structures:

1\. Hierarchical list

a. Emacs Org mode

b. LibreOffice

2\. Mindmap

a. Freeplane

b. MindNote

In a word, structured actions are effective and efficient for handling from daily affairs to life-scale career in a template-based, procedural and iterative way.
