Let $$\alpha$$ be a covector and $$u$$ be a vector. The application of
$$\alpha$$ to $$u$$, i.e. $$\alpha(u)$$ can be considered as the vector $$u$$
being measured by the covector $$\alpha$$ via projection. If the covector
$$\alpha$$ does not have a unit magnitude or length, the resulted scalar
value will be scaled by this magnitude.

Therefore, the covector $$\alpha$$ plays the role of a ruler and its
magnitude is just the **reciprocal** of the inter-distance between two
adjacent marks on the ruler's scale. Such inter-distance is selected as
the unit for the said measurement. The smaller the unit, the larger the
register of the measurement. This understanding is consistent with the
illustration of covectors presented in (Burke 1985). In this book, a
covector is represented as two parallel lines with an arrow. The
inter-distance of the two lines is the reciprocal of the covector's
length.
