Customizing the font family used in Firefox reader mode is helpful to increase online reading experience. This can be achieved according to the following procedure.

1. Open the address `about:support` in Firefox and open the profile folder.

2. If the folder `chrome` does not exist, create it. Then create a CSS file `userContent.css` in the `chrome` folder with the following contents as example, where Iâ€™ve adopted my favorite font `KaiTi` for reading Chinese articles and `Noto Serif` for English contents.
   ```css
.moz-reader-content { 
  font-family: "KaiTi", "Noto Serif", "Times New Roman", serif;
} 
   ```
3. Open `about:config` in Firefox and change the option `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`.
4. Restart Firefox to take effect.

If you want, more styles and features can be customized with the help of the Developer Tool in Firefox.
