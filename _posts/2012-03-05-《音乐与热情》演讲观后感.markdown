What am I being if there are no shining eyes? This is the essence that Benjamin Zander wants to convey to us during his TED speech "The Transformative Power of Classical Music" ([http://www.bilibili.com/video/av792738](http://www.bilibili.com/video/av792738)). This spirit is embodied in his belief that no one is tone deaf, in his narration about the magic power of classical music, in his vivid and sensation-provoking play of Chopin's prelude–and this is a piece of melancholy music which makes you recollect your home, your past memories, etc. It is surprised to see that after hundreds of years, the music can still touch the soul deep in our hearts. Moreover, I found out how strong and everlasting the effect of a good talk can give us, which is also where wisdom and creativity come from: they root in our rational understandings of the world, in new perspectives towards the nature, in the continuous refresh and discovery of the true meaning of our lives. During the course of our aspiration for pure truth and extreme beauty, these spirits can be spread to encourage other people. It is just their shining eyes that are best proof of our efforts.
