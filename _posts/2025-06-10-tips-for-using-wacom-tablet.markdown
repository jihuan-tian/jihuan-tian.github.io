-   When drawing long lines on the tablet, we should not press our palm too hard on the tablet, otherwise, the friction hinders a smooth motion of the palm and the resultant stroke will be discontinuous or have wiggles.
-   While the fingers should hold the pen steady, but should not be too tight to be flexible for fine control of the strokes.
-   Do not use cursive handwriting, which is difficult to recognize and looks messy. Use the print handwriting style.
-   Don&rsquo;t be meticulous about strokes and calligraphy, just concentrate on the contents. Remember that the purpose of sketching and handwriting is not to show off but to assist our thinking process and take snapshots of our mind.
