The exploration in the maze of science is quite similar to walking in a dungeon with a shimmering light surrounding your body. You can only see a few feet all around. Beyond that, the light fades out into the impalpable and vacant darkness like a Gaussian function. At the beginning, unknowns are pervasive, you are immersed in doubts and fears. Frequent bumping into dead end squeezes you into madness and despair. However, as you descend deeper into the ground, you gradually get used to the darkness both visually and psychologically. No matter how hard and suffering, the brightness of your rationality is always your most comfort: it moves with you as you wander in the dungeon until the exit to the ground is found. It is better if such light can reach a larger range during this pilgrim, so that more details of and connections with the other areas will be revealed. However, this is not your ultimate purpose but a subordinate benefit. In addition, you also have alternative ways to find the exit. It’s wise to select the shortest and most effective path. It’s solid and safe to pave all the routes. It’s risky but fascinating to explore without aim. However, in order to solve a problem, you don’t need to recursively traverse every possibility in the maze. The whole dungeon needs not be lit after all.
