When a bug appears with `weird phenomena`, calm down instead of being frivolous or freaked out.

Do not be confined in the intensive mode and only focus on a very-limited code block. On the contrary, be patient and use the diffusive mode to read large amount of source code, let them trickle and infiltrate into my whole body, mind, heart and soul. Finally, the definitive cause of the error will emerge.
