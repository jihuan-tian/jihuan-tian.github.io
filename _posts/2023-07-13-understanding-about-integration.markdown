The essence of integration of a differential $$k$$-form
$$\int_{\Omega} \omega$$ is to discretize the domain into infinitesimal
patches, project the $$k$$-form onto each of them, then take the sum.
Since there is projection, there is the inner product operation, which
naturally involves these dual pairs: vector and covector, $$k$$-vector
and $$k$$-form, $$k$$-vector field and differential $$k$$-form.
