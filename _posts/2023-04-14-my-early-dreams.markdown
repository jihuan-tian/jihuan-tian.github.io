I wrote the following diary on March 14, 2013, which is a testimony of my early dreams about numerical simulation. Even though I was vague and uncertain about how things would be at that time, it still laid out my inclinations and directions towards math study and algorithm development in the following years. Now, entering into age 40s, I've realized some of them after all and there are for sure more work to be done in the future.

> Before reading Prof. Ralf Hiptmair's papers, functional analysis, differential manifold and a little topology should be reviewed and read. Furthermore, these study and reading should be considered as a personal hobby.
>
> It is actually a long term goal which requires persistent efforts. However, this target is still practical and realistic. Just like what Willi has always been doing for his physics everyday, I can also continue studying PDE, numerical analysis, topology, etc. such difficult subjects. There is nothing to be afraid of or to feel any nervous.
>
> After several years study before I'm forty, I think all of the above subjects must have been managed by myself. And forty is just the similar age as present Prof. Ralf.

> There is still a long way to go in order to achieve the above goal. During this period, I shall never refuse to do simpler things! One cannot reach for what is beyond his grasp too much. Even for the expert, such as Andreas and Joerg, they are still doing engineering work and solving simple problem. This will not prevent them from doing more fundamental and theoretical research.
