-   Falcon
    -   Most launches in a single year: 96, more than Soviet Soyuz 63 times.
    -   Heavy Falcon: 5 times, more than Saturn-V
    -   Starlink tasks: 2/3 of all tasks
    -   Falcon 9: 19 repeated launches
    -   260 landings of boosters in the last 8 years
-   Fairing recovery: 300s times
-   Mass to orbit
    -   1200 tons in 2023, 80% of the world, 90% expected in 2024.
    -   Only 20% of the mass in Earth orbit can reach Mars. About one million tons of goods should be sent to Mars in order to be self-sustainable.
-   Dragon
    -   Have run for 1300 days in orbit
    -   43 total successful launches
    -   39 visits to ISS
    -   22 reflights
    -   sent 42 humans to space and taken back
    -   Two towers in Florida
    -   Walk in space in 2024
-   Starlink
    -   Enable people in remote places to learn
    -   Improve the quality of people&rsquo;s lives
    -   V2 minis: next generation Starlink satellite
        -   Increase data rate from 88 TBps to 165 TBps
        -   Target: delay below 20 ms
        -   Argon-Hall thruster
        -   In-space laser
            -   9000 active space lasers
            -   Each laser link has 100 Gbps transfer rate
        
        ![img](/figures/2024-01-14_09-28-47.png)
        
    -   Direct link to cell
        -   7 Mbps
        -   Good for text messages
        -   Suitable for remote regions, save people&rsquo;s lives
-   Starship
    
    ![img](/figures/2024-01-14_09-40-42.png)
    
    -   Thrust: currently is more than 2 times than Saturn V. The target is more than 20 million pounds, while Saturn V is 7.5 million pounds.
    -   Earth-to-earth transportation
    -   Upgrades between 1st and 2nd launch
        -   Launch pad: large water pressure
        -   Will build 2nd tower
        -   Migrate hydraulic to electric actuation of engines
        -   Almost everything has been upgraded from the 1st to 2nd launch, thousands of upgrades
        -   Hot staging achieved within 3 to 4 months
        -   If there were actual load, there would have been no oxygen venting and Starship would have go into orbit.
    -   3rd launch
        -   Accelerate build and test: time is more expensive than hardware
        -   Becomes taller: 140 or 150 m
        -   Target
            -   Enter orbit and de-orbit
            -   Propellant transfer between header and main tanks at a tipping point
    -   Mass to orbit: 150 tons, while Falcon Heavy is 64 tons.
    -   On orbit refilling at the end of 2024 or early 2025
    -   Starlink deploy at the end of 2024
    -   NASA human landing system, Artemis program. Land on moon and build moon base
