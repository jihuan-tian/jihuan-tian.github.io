In James Munkres "Topology" Section 22, the quotient space is defined as below.

**Definition** Let $$X$$ be a topological space, and let $$X^*$$ be a partition of $$X$$ into disjoint subsets whose union is $$X$$. Let $$p: X \rightarrow X^*$$ be the surjective map that carries each point of $$X$$ to the element of $$X^*$$ containing it. In the quotient topology induced by $$p$$, the space $$X^*$$ is called a quotient space of $$Xâ€‹$$.

The key factors in this definition are:

1. According to section 3, the quotient space $$X^*$$ as a partition of $$X$$ is associated with a unique equivalence relation on $$X$$. This equivalence relation specifies which points in the original space $$X$$ will be treated as a same point in the new space $$X^*$$.
2. The quotient map $$p: X \rightarrow X^*$$ for constructing the quotient topology on $$X^*$$ introduces the concept of saturated sets, which are pre-images of subsets in $$X^*$$. $$p$$ ensures the image of any saturated open/closed set in $$X$$ is still open/closed in $$X^*$$.

With these concepts in mind, we can take paper folding and pasting as an example. Let the space $$X$$ be a piece of paper. The equivalence classes on $$X$$ determine which parts of this piece of paper will be pasted together. Meanwhile, the quotient map $$p$$ collects the neighborhoods around every points in $$X$$ that are to be pasted into a common point $$x_0$$ in $$X^*$$ and builds up a new neighborhood of $$x_0$$ in $$X^*$$. The neighborhoods of points in $$X$$ are defined with respect to the subspace topology on $$X$$, which is induced from the standard topology on $$\mathbb{R}^2$$. The neighborhoods of points in $$X^*$$ are defined with respect to the quotient topology on $$X^*$$. That the quotient map $$p$$ is surjective implies the whole paper is kept during the operations without cutting off any part. Hence, the obtained quotient space $$X^*$$ is just the piece of paper after these folding and pasting operations. The following figure illustrates the above metaphor of quotient space by folding a piece of rectangular paper into a cylinder.
