Following these steps will do the work.

1. Use `gitÂ status`  to check the file status.
2. Use `grep` to search for the `modified` keyword.  
3. Extract the second column by using `cut` with the delimiter `:`.
4. Remove surplus white spaces in front of the data field by using `sed`.
5. Connect the above commands in sequence via pipes.
6. Quote the command list using \`\`, the result of which will be passed as the argument of `git add`.

The train of commands looks like this.

```bash
git add `git status | grep modified | cut -d ":" -f 2 | sed -e 's/^\s*//'`
```

Similarly, this method can be adapted for committing files in other status.
