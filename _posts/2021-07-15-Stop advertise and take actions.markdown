Do not advertise concepts, ideas, principles, methods or core values to other people. Do not even try to influence them with the beliefs you cherish. For even though they fully agree with your point of view, they may quite probably lack the corresponding background and experiences for stimulating a self renovation. The occurrence of such impetus not only depends on how strong one's resolution is, but also requires a fateful coincidence.

Therefore, the task of first priority is to follow your rationale thoughts, establish a system of doctrines, adhere to them, take actions to verify, revise and solidify them. If there is any true value thereof, it will manifest itself.
