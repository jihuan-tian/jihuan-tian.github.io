According to (Nelson 2008)[^1] P58

-   base
    1.  (of a number system) The number represented by the numeral ‘10’ in a positional number system. Thus, in the decimal system the base (ten) is represented by 10; in a binary system the base (two) is also represented by 10.
    2.  (of logarithms) The number which, raised to the power of a given logarithm, produces a given number. Thus, if the logarithm of x to base b (written as logb x) is y, then by = x.
    3.  A line or plane in a geometric figure relative to which the altitude of the figure is measured.
-   basis pl. bases: A subset of a vector space that is linearly independent and spans the space.

Therefore, when we talk about the basis of some space, such as an Euclidean space or Sobolev space, the word **basis** itself is already a collection of elements in this space, while any single one of them should be described as **basis element** or **basis function**. On the other hand, **base** should never appear in such occasions. Also note the plural form of basis coincides with that of base.
