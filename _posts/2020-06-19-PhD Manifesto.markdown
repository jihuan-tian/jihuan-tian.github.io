The following PhD Manifesto was drafted by me on Mar 17, 2019. Now, after more than one year, when I introspect about these opinions, I still think they are valid and will always be a ringing alert to me just in case that I am not industrious enough or deviate from my ultimate mission.

## PhD Manifesto

**1. A PhD should not be one of the inlays on the edifice of an organization.** 

**2. A PhD should not be an underling of the capital system.** 

**3. A PhD should not pompously claim combinatorial variations as innovation.** 

**4. A PhD should not degenerate from a maker into a user.**
