A scholar, like a maker or craftsman, should not condescend to be a manager or an organizer. Since this will only make him/her satisfied about the control of resources and the power over other people, instead of discover the beauty and verity behind conscientious deeds and destined cause.

A scholar, like a maker or craftsman, should have his/her own persistent and consistent core masterpiece to build up, piece by piece, little by little. Such kind of fundamental and infrastructural work spanning a personâ€™s life scale cannot be expected from an large organization, in which he/she really feels safe but unnecessarily wastes energy, focus and strong desire. Nor can it be acquired from a capital investment, which makes him/her satiated but divert the original purpose of building something great to exploiting short term profits.
