[Measurement and duality](https://youtu.be/xRf9-hdxB0w?list=PL9_jI1bdZmz0hIrNCMQW1YmZysAiIYSSS&t=243) mentioned in Lecture 4 $$k $$-forms of the [CMU Discrete Differential Geometry course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9_jI1bdZmz0hIrNCMQW1YmZysAiIYSSS) is enlightening. Inner product of two vectors $$u$$ and $$v$$ is just a kind of such measurement, which is intrinsically a projection operation. $$v $$ is the vector to be measured and $$u $$ is the vector for measuring. Even though $$u $$ and $$v $$ are both vectors in an Euclidean space, they have different identities. That&rsquo;s why during the evaluation of $$(u, v) $$, $$u $$ is written as a row vector, while $$v $$ is a column vector. Similar cases arise in other areas, such as in functional analysis, a vector in a Hilbert space is associated with its dual vector via the Riesz representation theorem; in quantum mechanics, there is the demarcation of ket $$\langle\psi \vert $$ and bra $$\vert\varphi\rangle $$; in PDE or FEM, ansatz and test basis functions are adopted to discretize bilinear forms.
