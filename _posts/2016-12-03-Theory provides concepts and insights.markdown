It is never true that the more data the better. Sticking to this idea may lead to a migration from essence to phenomenon and from real physics to virtual visualizations. My previous research experiences on space charge dynamics in solid dielectrics tell me that although the advanced measurement unprecedentedly makes the acquisition of abundant and beautiful data possible, people's understandings of the underlying physical mechanisms are not improved. Or the situation may be even worse, i.e. the classical theories are gradually covered with dust and fade out from people's mind.

Theory provides concepts and insights, while data bring phenomenological phantom.
