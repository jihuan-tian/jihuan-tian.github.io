**Phenomenon** When I edit an Org mode buffer which has been opened in two Emacs windows for side-by-side review, the cursor will irregularly jump, **within the same window**, from the current position to the cursor position in another window, even though I have not clicked any link.

**Possible cause** Overlays generated by `texfrag`.

**Solution** Clone the buffer into another window by calling `clone-indirect-buffer-other-window`. However, LaTeX previews from `texfrag` in these two windows are no synchronized, which should be independently generated.
