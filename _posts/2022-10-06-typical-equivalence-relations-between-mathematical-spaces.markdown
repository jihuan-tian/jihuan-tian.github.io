-   Bijection: this is the equivalence in the sense of one-to-one and surjective mapping or correspondence between two sets.
-   Isomorphism: this is the equivalence in the sense of algebraic structure of groups.
-   Homeomorphism: this is the equivalence in the sense of topology and requires the forward map $$f$$ and backward map $$f^{-1}$$ to be continuous. It includes bijection.
-   Isometry: this is the equivalence in the sense of metric.
-   Differentiable homeomorphism: it is a homeomorphism with the forward map $$f$$ being differentiable.
-   Diffeomorphism: it is a homeomorphism with both the forward map $$f$$ and backward map $$f^{-1}$$ being differentiable.
