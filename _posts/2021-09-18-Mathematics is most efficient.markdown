Mathematics is most efficient, for it solves a category of problems instead of a specific one across multiple disciplines via abstraction and unification.

Mathematics is most cost effective, for it only requires a lucid brain to contemplate, a pencil and a piece of paper to make draft, a moderate computer to verify ideas through the simplest model.

Mathematics is never labor intensive. As an art instead of a project, its practitioner desires a consistent design and delicate control of his/her work. The more people involved, the messier the scenario becomes.
