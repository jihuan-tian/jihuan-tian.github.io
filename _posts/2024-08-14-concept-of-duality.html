<p class='indent'>   Duality can be considered as a weak form of symmetry. According to Wikipedia, in mathematics, a duality
translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures in a
one-to-one fashion, often (but not always) by means of an involution operation: if the dual of A is B, then the
dual of B is A, i.e. if the involution is represented as \(f\), we have \(f(f(A)) = A\).
</p><!-- l. 28 --><p class='indent'>   Taking the familiar inner product in linear algebra as an example (see Figure <a href='#x1-2r1'>1<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:inner-product-of-vectors  --></a>). The two vectors \(a\) and \(b\) have
equal status, both of which are vectors in \(\mathbb {R}^n\). The meaning of inner product \(\left \langle a,b \right \rangle \) or \(a\cdot b\) is projecting \(b\) to \(a\). From the view of
measurement, \(a\) is the measurement device and \(b\) is the object to be measured. For example, \(a\) can be imagined as an
electric field meter, \(b\) is the electric field. When the meter is aligned with the electric field line, it registers
maximum value. With this understanding, even though both \(a\) and \(b\) are vectors in \(\mathbb {R}^n\), we have a feeling that they
have something different. If we adopt a matrix form to represent their inner product , \(a\) is a row vector, i.e. an \(1 \times n\)
matrix, and \(b\) is a column vector, i.e. \(n\times 1\) matrix. Such a formal difference implies they are different
types of vectors and the concept of duality is embodied in the correspondence between row and
column.

<!-- l. 49 --><p class='indent'>   Adopting the functional analysis point of view, \(\left \langle a,b \right \rangle \) or \(a\cdot b\) can be written as \(a(b)\). Now \(b\) is an element in the space \(X\) and \(a: X \rightarrow \mathbb {R}\) is
a linear functional or operator in the dual space \(X'\). In essence, \(a\) and \(b\) have different status and they are dual to each
other.
</p><!-- l. 54 --><p class='indent'>   In computer programming, \(a\) can be considered as a function or more generally a function object, while \(b\) is the
data or operand to be manipulated.
</p><!-- l. 57 --><p class='indent'>   In differential geometry, the core concepts of tangent space and cotangent space are dual to each other. Let \(M^n\) be
an \(n\)-dimensional manifold which contains the point \(p\). \(M_p^n\) is the tangent space at \(p\). The dual space of \(M_p^n\) is the called
the cotangent space at \(p\), which is written as \(M_p^{n*}\). A linear operator \(\alpha : M_p^n \rightarrow \mathbb {R}\) in the cotangent space \(M_p^{n*}\) is called a
cotangent vector or covariant vector or covector or 1-form. Applying this 1-form \(\alpha \) to a tangent vector
\(b\), we obtain a scalar value. Due to Riesz representation theorem <a href='#x1-31'>1<!-- tex4ht:ref: theo:riesz-representation  --></a>, there exists a unique tangent
vector \(a\) such that \(\alpha (b) = \left \langle a, b \right \rangle \). This means the behavior of \(\alpha \) is governed by the inner product with respect to
\(a\).
