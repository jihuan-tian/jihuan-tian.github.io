Writing on paper notebook is somehow different from typing at a computer or writing with Apple Pencil on an iPad. On the real paper, although the handwriting is merely scribbles, the mind and heart are free during the process of scratching. It seems like a direct communication with the soul. Because of this immersive working style, it is easier for you to keep focus and enter into a deep work mode. However, when using a computer or an iPad, such kind of freedom is much limited. This is because besides the mental activities, you have to spare additional energy and focus to deal with trifles related to editing operations unless you are so familiar with these techniques that you can ignore the existence of the electronic device. But still, repetitive body and eye strain injury is ineluctable, which will eventually reduce your efficiency and bring irreparable harm. This is especially worth your caution because working in focus and deep mode is usually a persistent time-consuming process, which exacerbates the said adverse effects significantly.

Therefore, it is more appropriate to work on paper notebook for purposes such as concept design, meditation and introspection, mathematical deduction, etc. After the most appealing flashes of ideas are captured and the genuine words are poured out, the stuff that have been taken down can then be organized into electronic devices with relief and leisure. This kind of relief and leisure is both biological and psychological. For the biological aspect, it makes your eyes more relaxed when you facing the screen, because with a rudiment in hand, there is no need to exert extreme focus on the editing chores. For the psychological aspect, because the gist has been settled and the logical structure has been laid out, you will feel more definite confidence to carry our further refinements and optimizations.

In short, writing on paper notebook is still an indispensable way in present days for organizing information, summarizing study notes and mapping the mind when typing and handwriting on electronic devices are much more convenient and agreeable than ever before.
