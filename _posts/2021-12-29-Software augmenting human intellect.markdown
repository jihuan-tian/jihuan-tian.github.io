[Augmented intelligence](https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/) system was initially proposed by Engelbart in 1962. For a manifestation of this concept in software platforms and tools, they should at least possess the following features according to my current understanding.

-   Being free instead of proprietary. This brings the possibility of a longer persistence of both the software itself and the produced data. Meanwhile, it is easier and more feasible to add new functionalities customized and adapted to our needs and habits.
-   Having a large scale framework and adequate complicated features. This ensures us to use it for serious and titanic work with a definitive quality.
-   Being programmable and extensible. This can be achieved via a plugin layer or the software itself can be directly accessed and interacted via programming. Being not only a tool but also a tool for making new tools, the software can be delicately tuned and adapted to our needs and habits, integrated with us as a whole.

Some good examples that I recommend: Emacs, AUCTeX, Org mode, LaTeX.
