<!-- l. 22 --><p class='indent'>   Let \(M^n\) be a manifold which is assigned two coordinate charts \((U)\) and \((V)\). These two coordinate charts have a
non-empty overlap, so that any point \(p\) in their intersection \(U\cap V\) has two numerical representations. The
coordinate transformation from \((V)\) to \((U)\) is characterized by the transition map \(\Phi _{UV}\). Also note that \((U)\) and \((V)\) may
have different number of coordinate components. For example, for a unit sphere embedded in the
3D space \(\mathbb {R}^3\), we can use either Cartesian coordinates \((x,y,z)\) or altitude-azimuth angles \((\theta , \phi )\) to characterize
it.

     <!-- l. 25 --><p class='noindent'>The \(i\)-th column vector of the Jacobian matrix \(J_{UV}\) for the transition map \(\Phi _{UV}\), if evaluated at a point \(p\) in the
     overlap \(U\cap V\), is the \(i\)-th basis vector of the tangent space rooted at \(p\) in the chart \((V)\), which is numerically
     represented by the basis of the chart \((U)\). N.B. This basis vector in the tangent space may not be a
     normalized vector.

     <!-- l. 26 --><p class='noindent'>If the coordinate chart \((V)\) has \(k\) components, there are \(k\) columns in the Jacobian matrix, which span an
     oriented parallelogram.

     <!-- l. 27 --><p class='noindent'>For a fixed tangent vector at \(p\), the Jacobian matrix \(J_{UV}\) can transform its coordinates in \((V)\) to \((U)\).
     </p><!-- l. 29 --><p class='noindent'>Coordinate transformation  in  robotics  is  just  a  special  case,  where  both  \((U)\)  and  \((V)\)  are  flat  frames.
     If all frames have a common origin, i.e. there is only rotation but no translation between them,
     the transition map \(\Phi _{UV}\) is a rotation matrix, which is also the Jacobian matrix \(J_{UV}\). The rotation matrix
     from  chart  \((U)\)  to  \((V)\)  can  be  constructed  by  representing  each  basis  vector  of  chart  \((V)\)  in  chart  \((U)\).  Each
     numerical representation of the basis vector is a column vector and all such column vectors are
     placed horizontally as a rotation matrix \(R\). This rotation matrix \(R\) is just the Jacobian matrix \(J_{UV}\) from \((V)\) to \((U)\)

     Then for a fixed poitn \(p\), its coordinates in the two charts are related as \(P^U = RP^V\), which is consistent with \(P^U = J_{UV} P^{V}\).
