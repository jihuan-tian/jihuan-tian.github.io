## Preface to "Learning English words via sentences"

Words and sentences are mortar and bricks of English language. If they are further concerted by a logical mind and styled by a sentimental heart, a good piece of writing can be produced.

Mastering a word can be likened to understanding a person. We need to know its origin, history and story, not just the literal meanings. We should also have a sense of the word’s color and connotation, which differentiate it from its synonyms. A word may have several distinct meanings and functions at the same time. Getting familiar with them will rapidly double our vocabulary. Moreover, it is beneficial to know the word’s derivatives and relatives, which is similar to categorizing people into typical classes according to their identities and personalities. Once there is an emotional link between us and the word, as well as its example sentences that provide vivid context, we can say that the word has been in our possession.

The aim of compiling this document is the desire to accurately master the meaning and connotation of English words by learning from example sentences. This is because a sentence can provide a context for easy understanding and remembering. The following sentences are mainly selected from Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster Dictionary etc, or sometimes created by myself.
