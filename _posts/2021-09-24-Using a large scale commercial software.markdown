Using a large scale commercial software is like working in a behemoth: everything goes on smoothly and efficiently, and you will become fruitful in a short time. All of these leave you the mirage that you are powerful and successful, or even a domain “luminary”. However, this should be attributed to the resource and know-how of the platform accumulated for a long time, which have never been your own craft. For everyone, a choice must be made between quick success according to protean secular standards and slow exaltation based on absolute and transcendent values.
