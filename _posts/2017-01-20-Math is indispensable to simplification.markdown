One of the tasks or effects introduced by mathematics is to make things simpler by creating new abstract concepts, producing various categories, prescribing definitions and rules, building logical framework, etc. Unfortunately, due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools, some applied “theories” (literally, they are not real theories due to the missing of rigorousness and rationality) become incredibly complicated and unnecessarily cumbersome, even though the mathematics to be involved are not at all difficult to play with. There may be two reasons in the following explaining this situation.

1\. Normal people are usually afraid of mathematics at the first glance even without thinking for a while.

2\. People are usually in a hurry and hunger for short-term profit.

Hence, they do not possess the required tranquility and patience to collect and organize those minute and multifarious logical details in mathematics. They even have never wanted to change this situation through their whole lives.
