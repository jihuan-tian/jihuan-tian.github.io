A real and practical writing process is not to firstly bash away at a relatively rounded idea with a rigorous deduction, then start to key in each word by following the mind map. On the contrary, the writing and thinking activities are usually interweaved in a symbiotic fashion.

Writing can help us calm down, keep focus, organize thoughts and get into the state of flow. At the beginning, sporadic keywords and incomplete sentences will emerge within our heads, which should be faithfully captured into a tagged note or card system. When we accumulate these elements to a certain amount with care and patience, they will feed back to us with a clearer understanding and help establish an emotional link between our mindset and the topic being studied. In the subsequent iterations of this process, we persistently revise and refine the embryonic draft, like a sculptor contemplating and working on an unfinished statue in the studio. But writing is much easier than sculpting, because there are version control tools like Git, which embolden us to write anew with a different style or unfold the logic using a different perspective. By creating branches, we are relieved of the worry about messing up the draft.

For short, writing is an indispensable measure to push us towards a mature and logical thinking. When the thinking process culminates, an article naturally takes shape.
