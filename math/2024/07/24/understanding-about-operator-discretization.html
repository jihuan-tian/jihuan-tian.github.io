Let \(V_h\) be the finite dimensional subspace of \(V\) with the basis \(\left \{ \varphi _{1},\cdots ,\varphi _{n} \right \}\) and \(W_h\) be the finite dimensional subspace of \(W\) with the basis \(\left \{ \zeta _{1},\cdots ,\zeta _{p} \right \}\). Let \(W&#39;\) be the dual space of \(W\) and \(W_h&#39;\) be its finite dimensional subspace with the basis \(\left \{ \psi _{1},\cdots ,\psi _{m} \right \}\). Let \(A: V \rightarrow W\) be a bounded linear operator from \(V\) to \(W\) and \(A_h: V_h \rightarrow W_h\) be its finite dimensional approximation. A function \(u_h\in V_h\) can be expanded as \(u_h=\sum _{i=1}^n u_i \varphi _i\). Its expansion coefficients make up the strong form vector \(\underline {u} = (u_1,\cdots ,u_n)^{\mathrm {T}}\) of \(u_h\). Here we explicitly write this vector as \(\underline {u}^{\mathrm {S}}\) to be differentiated from the weak form. To discretize the operator \(A_h\), we need two steps: Apply \(A_h\) to \(u_h\), which produces a function \(w_h\) in \(W_h\). Project \(w_h\) to each basis function \(\psi _i\) of \(W_h&#39;\). The said projection is formed by duality pairing \(\left \langle \cdot ,\cdot \right \rangle _{W_h&#39;,W_h}\) 1 and will produce a vector \(\underline {w}^{\mathrm {W}}\), which is the weak form of \(w_h\). This vector is not related to the expansion coefficients \(w_k\) of \(w_h\) in \(W_h\), i.e. \(w_h = \sum _{k=1}^p w_k\zeta _k\), but is the projection coefficients of \(w_h\) in the dual space \(W_h&#39;\). The expression for \(\underline {w}^{\mathrm {W}}\) can be expanded as \begin{equation} \underline {w}^{\mathrm {W}} = \begin {pmatrix} \left \langle \psi _1, w_h \right \rangle \\ \vdots \\ \left \langle \psi _m, w_h \right \rangle \end {pmatrix} = \begin {pmatrix} \left \langle \psi _1,A_hu_h \right \rangle \\ \vdots \\ \left \langle \psi _m,A_hu_h \right \rangle \end {pmatrix} = \begin {pmatrix} \left \langle \psi _1,A_h\sum _{j=1}^n u_j\varphi _j \right \rangle \\ \vdots \\ \left \langle \psi _m,A_h\sum _{j=1}^n u_j\varphi _j \right \rangle \end {pmatrix} = \begin {pmatrix} \sum _{j=1}^n \left \langle \psi _1, A_h \varphi _j \right \rangle u_j \\ \vdots \\ \sum _{j=1}^n \left \langle \psi _m, A_h \varphi _j \right \rangle u_j \end {pmatrix}. \end{equation} Its matrix form is \begin{equation} \underline {w}^{\mathrm {W}} = \mathcal {A} \underline {u}^{\mathrm {S}}, \end{equation} where \(\mathcal {A}_{ij} = \left \langle \psi _i, A_h\varphi _j \right \rangle \). If we substitute \(w_h = \sum _{k=1}^p w_k\zeta _k\) into the left hand side of this equation, we have \begin{equation} \underline {w}^{\mathrm {W}} = \begin {pmatrix} \left \langle \psi _1, \sum _{k=1}^p w_i\zeta _k \right \rangle \\ \vdots \\ \left \langle \psi _m, \sum _{k=1}^p w_i\zeta _k \right \rangle \end {pmatrix} = \begin {pmatrix} \sum _{k=1}^p \left \langle \psi _1, \zeta _k \right \rangle w_k \\ \vdots \\ \sum _{k=1}^p \left \langle \psi _m, \zeta _k \right \rangle w_k \\ \end {pmatrix} = \begin {pmatrix} \sum _{j=1}^n \left \langle \psi _1, A_h \varphi _j \right \rangle u_j \\ \vdots \\ \sum _{j=1}^n \left \langle \psi _m, A_h \varphi _j \right \rangle u_j \end {pmatrix}. \end{equation} Its matrix form is \begin{equation} \underline {w}^{\mathrm {W}} = \mathcal {M}_{W_h&#39;,W_h} \underline {w}^{\mathrm {S}} = \mathcal {A} \underline {u}^{\mathrm {S}}. \end{equation} In this equation, \(\mathcal {M}_{W_h&#39;,W_h}\) is the mass matrix associated with the duality pairing between the dual space \(W_h&#39;\) and the range space \(W_h\) with respect to the operator \(A\) 2. For simplicity, this matrix is written as \(\mathcal {M}_A\). The vector \(\underline {w}^{\mathrm {S}}\) contains the actual expansion coefficients \((w_{1},\cdots ,w_{p})^{\mathrm {T}}\) of \(w_h\) in \(W_h\), therefore it is the strong form of \(w_h\), which can be derived from the weak form of \(w_h\) as below: \begin{equation} \underline {w}^{\mathrm {S}} = \mathcal {M}_A^{-1} \underline {w}^{\mathrm {W}} = \mathcal {M}_A^{-1}\mathcal {A}\underline {u}^{\mathrm {S}}. \end{equation} This means the mass matrix \(\mathcal {M}_A\) should be a square matrix and invertible, which requires two conditions: The number of basis elements adopted for the range space \(W_h\) of \(A\) should be the same as that for the dual space \(W_h&#39;\). Take the single layer potential (SLP) operator \(V: H^{-1/2}(\Gamma ) \rightarrow H^{1/2}(\Gamma )\) in BEM as an example. \(W\) is \(H^{1/2}(\Gamma )\) and \(W&#39;\) is \(H^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\). \(W_h\) is usually the piecewise linear continuous function space and \(W_h&#39;\) is the piecewise constant function space. Basis functions of the former space are configured at nodes in the mesh, while basis functions for the latter space are configured in cells. Therefore, the number of basis functions of the two spaces usually mismatch. The remedy is to construct the space \(W_h&#39;\) on the dual mesh, then there is a one-to-one correspondence between each cell in the dual mesh and each node in the primal mesh. The duality pairing between \(W_h&#39;\) and \(W_h\) should be \(\inf \sup \) stable in the sense that the following condition should be satisfied (Betcke et al.) \begin{equation} \inf _{u\in W_h} \sup _{v\in W_h&#39;} \frac {\lvert \left \langle u,v \right \rangle \rvert }{\lVert u \rVert _{W_h} \lVert v \rVert _{W_h&#39;}} \geq c &gt; 0. \end{equation} Then the mass matrix \(\mathcal {M}_A\) is invertible. This \(\inf \sup \) stability is just the unique solvability condition or well-posedness condition of the following variational formulation: given \(f\in V&#39;\), find \(u\in U\), such that \begin{equation} a(u,v) = \left \langle f, v \right \rangle \quad \forall v\in V. \end{equation} Such a variational formulation involves the generalized bilinear form \(a(\cdot ,\cdot ): U\times V \rightarrow \mathbb {R}\), where the two component spaces \(U\) and \(V\) are different. Therefore, this condition is a generalization of the ellipticity condition involved in the Lax-Milgram Lemma, where the bilinear form requires two identical spaces. For the duality pairing \(\left \langle \cdot ,\cdot \right \rangle _{W_h&#39;, W_h}\), it is actually a bilinear form \(a(\cdot ,\cdot ): W_h\times W_h&#39; \rightarrow \mathbb {R}\) defined as \(a(u,v) := \left \langle v, Iu \right \rangle \), where \(I: W_h \rightarrow W_h\) is the identity operator. If the \(\inf \sup \) condition is satisfied, the mass matrix, as a discretization of the operator \(I\), is invertible. 2 Discretization of the inverse of an operator In BEM, when there is source distribution \(f\in \tilde {H}^{-1}(\Omega )\) in the volume domain \(\Omega \), the Newton potential \(N_0 f\) will also contribute to the Neumann trace at the boundary \(\Gamma \) as \(V^{-1}(N_0 f)\), where \(N_0: \tilde {H}^{-1}(\Omega ) \rightarrow H^{1/2}(\Gamma )\) and \(V^{-1}: H^{1/2}(\Gamma ) \rightarrow H^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\). It is obvious that if somehow we can directly discretize the inverse SLP operator \(V^{-1}\) into a matrix \(\mathcal {V}^{\dagger }\), its row and column function spaces are \(^{\mathrm {W}}H_h^{1/2}(\Gamma )\times ^{\mathrm {S}}H_h^{1/2}(\Gamma )\). On the other hand, if the matrix for \(V\) is \(\mathcal {V}\) and \(\mathcal {V}^{-1}\) is its inverse matrix, the row and column function spaces of \(\mathcal {V}^{-1}\) are \(^{\mathrm {S}}H_h^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\times ^{\mathrm {W}}H_h^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\). Therefore, \(\mathcal {V}^{\dagger }\) and \(\mathcal {V}^{-1}\) are two different matrices. N.B. Even though the function spaces related to matrices \(\mathcal {V}\) and \(\mathcal {V}^{-1}\) are the same \(H_h^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\times H_h^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\), the input or output vectors of the two matrices have different identities in the sense of strong or weak. In practice, an inverse operator like \(V^{-1}\) cannot be directly evaluated or discretized. We can only compute an approximation \(\tilde {\mathcal {V}^{\dagger }}\) of \(\mathcal {V}^{\dagger }\) by starting from the inverse of the matrix for the original operator, which is \(\mathcal {V}^{-1}\). In \(V^{-1}(N_0f)\), \(N_0f\) directly returns a strong form vector in \(H_h^{1/2}(\Gamma )\), which is the column space of the matrix \(\tilde {\mathcal {V}^{\dagger }}\). Hence we need to project this strong form vector from \(H_h^{1/2}(\Gamma )\) to the weak column space \(H_h^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\) of \(\mathcal {V}^{-1}\), and we can call this operation as space adaptation. This can be directly achieved by multiplying the mass matrix \(\mathcal {M}_{V}\) induced by the duality pairing between \(H_h^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\) and \(H_h^{1/2}(\Gamma )\). The output from \(\mathcal {V}^{-1}\) is a strong form vector in \(H_h^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\), which should be further mapped to the weak row space \(H_h^{1/2}(\Gamma )\) of \(\mathcal {V}^{\dagger }\). Because this is also a direct projection of a strong form vector to a weak form vector, we need to multiply the mass matrix \(\mathcal {M}_{V^{-1}}\) induced by the duality pairing between \(H_h^{1/2}(\Gamma )\) and \(H_h^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\). Let the basis of \(H_h^{1/2}(\Gamma )\) be \(\left \{ \varphi _{1},\cdots ,\varphi _{n} \right \}\) and the basis of \(H_h^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\) be \(\left \{ \psi _{1},\cdots ,\psi _{m} \right \}\). The coefficients of the above two mass matrices are \begin{equation} \mathcal {M}_V[i,j] = \left \langle \psi _i,\varphi _j \right \rangle \quad i=1,\cdots ,m, j=1,\cdots ,n \end{equation} and \begin{equation} \mathcal {M}_{V^{-1}}[i,j] = \left \langle \varphi _i,\psi _j \right \rangle \quad i=1,\cdots ,n, j=1,\cdots ,m. \end{equation} Therefore, \(\mathcal {M}_V = \mathcal {M}_{V^{-1}}^{\mathrm {T}}\). The matrix \(\tilde {\mathcal {V}}^{\dagger }\) as an approximate discretization of the inverse operator \(V^{-1}\) is \begin{equation} \tilde {\mathcal {V}^{\dagger }} = \mathcal {M}_V^{\mathrm {T}} \mathcal {V}^{-1} \mathcal {M}_V. \end{equation} The commutative diagram for the above operators and matrices is shown below, where the red route indicates the computation of \(\tilde {\mathcal {V}^{\dagger }}\) as the approximation for \(\mathcal {V}^{\dagger }\)." />

If we substitute \\(w_h = \\sum _{k=1}^p w_k\\zeta _k\\) into the left hand side of this equation, we have \\begin{equation} \\underline {w}^{\\mathrm {W}} = \\begin {pmatrix} \\left \\langle \\psi _1, \\sum _{k=1}^p w_i\\zeta _k \\right \\rangle \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\left \\langle \\psi _m, \\sum _{k=1}^p w_i\\zeta _k \\right \\rangle \\end {pmatrix} = \\begin {pmatrix} \\sum _{k=1}^p \\left \\langle \\psi _1, \\zeta _k \\right \\rangle w_k \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\sum _{k=1}^p \\left \\langle \\psi _m, \\zeta _k \\right \\rangle w_k \\\\ \\end {pmatrix} = \\begin {pmatrix} \\sum _{j=1}^n \\left \\langle \\psi _1, A_h \\varphi _j \\right \\rangle u_j \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\sum _{j=1}^n \\left \\langle \\psi _m, A_h \\varphi _j \\right \\rangle u_j \\end {pmatrix}. \\end{equation} Its matrix form is \\begin{equation} \\underline {w}^{\\mathrm {W}} = \\mathcal {M}_{W_h&#39;,W_h} \\underline {w}^{\\mathrm {S}} = \\mathcal {A} \\underline {u}^{\\mathrm {S}}. \\end{equation} In this equation, \\(\\mathcal {M}_{W_h&#39;,W_h}\\) is the mass matrix associated with the duality pairing between the dual space \\(W_h&#39;\\) and the range space \\(W_h\\) with respect to the operator \\(A\\) 2. For simplicity, this matrix is written as \\(\\mathcal {M}_A\\). The vector \\(\\underline {w}^{\\mathrm {S}}\\) contains the actual expansion coefficients \\((w_{1},\\cdots ,w_{p})^{\\mathrm {T}}\\) of \\(w_h\\) in \\(W_h\\), therefore it is the strong form of \\(w_h\\), which can be derived from the weak form of \\(w_h\\) as below: \\begin{equation} \\underline {w}^{\\mathrm {S}} = \\mathcal {M}_A^{-1} \\underline {w}^{\\mathrm {W}} = \\mathcal {M}_A^{-1}\\mathcal {A}\\underline {u}^{\\mathrm {S}}. \\end{equation} This means the mass matrix \\(\\mathcal {M}_A\\) should be a square matrix and invertible, which requires two conditions: The number of basis elements adopted for the range space \\(W_h\\) of \\(A\\) should be the same as that for the dual space \\(W_h&#39;\\). Take the single layer potential (SLP) operator \\(V: H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma ) \\rightarrow H^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\) in BEM as an example. \\(W\\) is \\(H^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\) and \\(W&#39;\\) is \\(H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\). \\(W_h\\) is usually the piecewise linear continuous function space and \\(W_h&#39;\\) is the piecewise constant function space. Basis functions of the former space are configured at nodes in the mesh, while basis functions for the latter space are configured in cells. Therefore, the number of basis functions of the two spaces usually mismatch. The remedy is to construct the space \\(W_h&#39;\\) on the dual mesh, then there is a one-to-one correspondence between each cell in the dual mesh and each node in the primal mesh. The duality pairing between \\(W_h&#39;\\) and \\(W_h\\) should be \\(\\inf \\sup \\) stable in the sense that the following condition should be satisfied (Betcke et al.) \\begin{equation} \\inf _{u\\in W_h} \\sup _{v\\in W_h&#39;} \\frac {\\lvert \\left \\langle u,v \\right \\rangle \\rvert }{\\lVert u \\rVert _{W_h} \\lVert v \\rVert _{W_h&#39;}} \\geq c &gt; 0. \\end{equation} Then the mass matrix \\(\\mathcal {M}_A\\) is invertible. This \\(\\inf \\sup \\) stability is just the unique solvability condition or well-posedness condition of the following variational formulation: given \\(f\\in V&#39;\\), find \\(u\\in U\\), such that \\begin{equation} a(u,v) = \\left \\langle f, v \\right \\rangle \\quad \\forall v\\in V. \\end{equation} Such a variational formulation involves the generalized bilinear form \\(a(\\cdot ,\\cdot ): U\\times V \\rightarrow \\mathbb {R}\\), where the two component spaces \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are different. Therefore, this condition is a generalization of the ellipticity condition involved in the Lax-Milgram Lemma, where the bilinear form requires two identical spaces. For the duality pairing \\(\\left \\langle \\cdot ,\\cdot \\right \\rangle _{W_h&#39;, W_h}\\), it is actually a bilinear form \\(a(\\cdot ,\\cdot ): W_h\\times W_h&#39; \\rightarrow \\mathbb {R}\\) defined as \\(a(u,v) := \\left \\langle v, Iu \\right \\rangle \\), where \\(I: W_h \\rightarrow W_h\\) is the identity operator. If the \\(\\inf \\sup \\) condition is satisfied, the mass matrix, as a discretization of the operator \\(I\\), is invertible. 2 Discretization of the inverse of an operator In BEM, when there is source distribution \\(f\\in \\tilde {H}^{-1}(\\Omega )\\) in the volume domain \\(\\Omega \\), the Newton potential \\(N_0 f\\) will also contribute to the Neumann trace at the boundary \\(\\Gamma \\) as \\(V^{-1}(N_0 f)\\), where \\(N_0: \\tilde {H}^{-1}(\\Omega ) \\rightarrow H^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\) and \\(V^{-1}: H^{1/2}(\\Gamma ) \\rightarrow H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\). It is obvious that if somehow we can directly discretize the inverse SLP operator \\(V^{-1}\\) into a matrix \\(\\mathcal {V}^{\\dagger }\\), its row and column function spaces are \\(^{\\mathrm {W}}H_h^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\times ^{\\mathrm {S}}H_h^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\). On the other hand, if the matrix for \\(V\\) is \\(\\mathcal {V}\\) and \\(\\mathcal {V}^{-1}\\) is its inverse matrix, the row and column function spaces of \\(\\mathcal {V}^{-1}\\) are \\(^{\\mathrm {S}}H_h^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\times ^{\\mathrm {W}}H_h^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathcal {V}^{\\dagger }\\) and \\(\\mathcal {V}^{-1}\\) are two different matrices. N.B. Even though the function spaces related to matrices \\(\\mathcal {V}\\) and \\(\\mathcal {V}^{-1}\\) are the same \\(H_h^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\times H_h^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\), the input or output vectors of the two matrices have different identities in the sense of strong or weak. In practice, an inverse operator like \\(V^{-1}\\) cannot be directly evaluated or discretized. We can only compute an approximation \\(\\tilde {\\mathcal {V}^{\\dagger }}\\) of \\(\\mathcal {V}^{\\dagger }\\) by starting from the inverse of the matrix for the original operator, which is \\(\\mathcal {V}^{-1}\\). In \\(V^{-1}(N_0f)\\), \\(N_0f\\) directly returns a strong form vector in \\(H_h^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\), which is the column space of the matrix \\(\\tilde {\\mathcal {V}^{\\dagger }}\\). Hence we need to project this strong form vector from \\(H_h^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\) to the weak column space \\(H_h^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\) of \\(\\mathcal {V}^{-1}\\), and we can call this operation as space adaptation. This can be directly achieved by multiplying the mass matrix \\(\\mathcal {M}_{V}\\) induced by the duality pairing between \\(H_h^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\) and \\(H_h^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\). The output from \\(\\mathcal {V}^{-1}\\) is a strong form vector in \\(H_h^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\), which should be further mapped to the weak row space \\(H_h^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\) of \\(\\mathcal {V}^{\\dagger }\\). Because this is also a direct projection of a strong form vector to a weak form vector, we need to multiply the mass matrix \\(\\mathcal {M}_{V^{-1}}\\) induced by the duality pairing between \\(H_h^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\) and \\(H_h^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\). Let the basis of \\(H_h^{1/2}(\\Gamma )\\) be \\(\\left \\{ \\varphi _{1},\\cdots ,\\varphi _{n} \\right \\}\\) and the basis of \\(H_h^{-1/2}(\\Gamma )\\) be \\(\\left \\{ \\psi _{1},\\cdots ,\\psi _{m} \\right \\}\\). The coefficients of the above two mass matrices are \\begin{equation} \\mathcal {M}_V[i,j] = \\left \\langle \\psi _i,\\varphi _j \\right \\rangle \\quad i=1,\\cdots ,m, j=1,\\cdots ,n \\end{equation} and \\begin{equation} \\mathcal {M}_{V^{-1}}[i,j] = \\left \\langle \\varphi _i,\\psi _j \\right \\rangle \\quad i=1,\\cdots ,n, j=1,\\cdots ,m. \\end{equation} Therefore, \\(\\mathcal {M}_V = \\mathcal {M}_{V^{-1}}^{\\mathrm {T}}\\). The matrix \\(\\tilde {\\mathcal {V}}^{\\dagger }\\) as an approximate discretization of the inverse operator \\(V^{-1}\\) is \\begin{equation} \\tilde {\\mathcal {V}^{\\dagger }} = \\mathcal {M}_V^{\\mathrm {T}} \\mathcal {V}^{-1} \\mathcal {M}_V. \\end{equation} The commutative diagram for the above operators and matrices is shown below, where the red route indicates the computation of \\(\\tilde {\\mathcal {V}^{\\dagger }}\\) as the approximation for \\(\\mathcal {V}^{\\dagger }\\).","headline":"Understanding about operator discretization","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jihuan-tian.github.io/math/2024/07/24/understanding-about-operator-discretization.html"},"url":"https://jihuan-tian.github.io/math/2024/07/24/understanding-about-operator-discretization.html"}</script>

dual space of the range space of the operator \(I+D\), i.e. \(^{\mathrm {S}}H^{-1/2}(\Gamma )\). However, as we mentioned above, the row
and column spaces of a preconditioned matrix should be in the strong form, and the row space
should be the range space of the operator \(I+D\). Therefore, we need to perform another weak form to
strong form transformation via the inverse of the matrix \(\mathcal {M}_D\). Finally, we obtain \begin{equation}  \mathcal {M}_D^{-1} (\tilde {\mathcal {M}} + \mathcal {D}) \mathcal {M}_D^{-\mathrm {T}} \mathcal {V}  \end{equation}<a id='x1-4008r17'></a> and the inverse of the
