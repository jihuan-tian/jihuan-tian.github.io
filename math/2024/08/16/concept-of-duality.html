a linear functional or operator in the dual space \(X'\). In essence, \(a\) and \(b\) have different status and they are dual to each

</p><!-- l. 57 --><p class='indent'>   In differential geometry, the core concepts of tangent space and cotangent space are dual to each other. Let \(M^n\) be
an \(n\)-dimensional manifold which contains the point \(p\). \(M_p^n\) is the tangent space at \(p\). The dual space of \(M_p^n\) is the called
the cotangent space at \(p\), which is written as \(M_p^{n*}\). A linear operator \(\alpha : M_p^n \rightarrow \mathbb {R}\) in the cotangent space \(M_p^{n*}\) is called a
cotangent vector or covariant vector or covector or 1-form. Applying this 1-form \(\alpha \) to a tangent vector
\(b\), we obtain a scalar value. Due to Riesz representation theorem <a href='#x1-31'>1<!-- tex4ht:ref: theo:riesz-representation  --></a>, there exists a unique tangent
vector \(a\) such that \(\alpha (b) = \left \langle a, b \right \rangle \). This means the behavior of \(\alpha \) is governed by the inner product with respect to
\(a\).
